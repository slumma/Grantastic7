"Fire Science Innovations through Research and Education (FIRE)","Wildland fire is a powerful force on the planet, one that is rapidly accelerating in complexity beyond our current understanding. A new approach is needed. This approach requires a proactive and scalable perspective that recognizes the variety and connectedness of components of wildland fire. Coordinated scientific research and education that enables large-scale, cross-cutting breakthroughs to transform our understanding of wildland fire is urgently needed. In an era of rapid change, our society needs forward-looking research built on new frameworks that will realign our relationship with wildland fire.
The Fire Science Innovations through Research and Education (FIRE) program invites innovative multidisciplinary and multisector investigations focused on convergent research and education activities in wildland fire. All areas of science, engineering, and education supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation are included in this program. Projects developed by a wide array of groups including, for example, academics, educators, scientists, community members, students, industry partners, practitioners, resource managers, and Tribal representatives, working together to generate new knowledge of the interactions among biological, social, geoscientific, and engineering processes encompassing multiple fields, scales, and perspectives on wildland fire are encouraged.
To advance convergent research and education in wildland fire science, FIRE proposals should demonstrate strengths in one or more of the following areas: (1) new advances in data collection, storage, and sharing relevant to wildland fire dynamics, including Earth observations; (2) new modeling and computational approaches to understand wildland fire (including artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches); (3) new understanding of the cross-scale interactions of wildland fire across local, regional and global extents; (4) new insights into community adaptation and governance relevant to wildland fire; (5) new approaches to reduce the vulnerability of built infrastructure, natural fuels, and social systems to wildland fire; and (6) engagement of a variety of community members and stakeholders to promote a forward-looking approach to wildland fire science.
NSF manages the review of proposals in consultation with partner organizations. Copies of proposals and unattributed reviews will be shared with the partner organizations, as appropriate.
FIRE supports research proposals and conference (network) proposals that focus on one or more of the following elements:
Focus area 1: Next Generation Coupled Fire Models (FIRE-MODEL)
Understanding wildland fires and smoke requires new predictive approaches and models to capture the full spatial and temporal range of unresolved dynamics. Furthermore, model development efforts necessitate well-coordinated experiments ranging from laboratory to landscape scales, along with state-of-the-art data management and analysis approaches. To reduce the current large uncertainties associated with fire models and to discover new weather-fire coupling phenomena driving the increasing frequency of large-scale fires worldwide, advanced experimental, theoretical, and computational methods are needed. The impacts of improved models include increased accuracy, better integration of Earth observation data, more efficient planning of prescribed burns, effective training of work force, timely warnings, and better management of limited human/equipment resources.
Successful FIRE-MODEL proposals are suggested to address the following key themes:

Innovative models, methods and algorithms for fire phenomena at disparate spatio-temporal scales, including systematic quantification of various sources of uncertainties and holistic verification and validation of the developed tools and technologies;  
Improvement of models with key measurable parameters spanning the full array of wildland fire factors as well as methods to bridge gaps of missing data;
Incorporation of the underlying processes operating on fast and slow timescales, to potentially enable predictive fire ecology, exploration of possible future fire regimes, and forecasting of future wildland fires; and
Novel mathematical and statistical methodologies and use-inspired technologies to accelerate experiments on wildland fire and smoke dynamics and reliably infer the associated uncertainties; such directions may include but are not limited to surrogate models and digital twins.

Focus area 2: Enhancing Capacity for Fire Resilience in the Wildland-Urban Interface (FIRE-WUI)
The space where the built environment and wildland vegetation meet is referred to as the wildland-urban interface (hereafter WUI). It represents a critical nexus of potential human-fire interaction, where lives, infrastructure, and communities are often most vulnerable to wildfire. Research related to the complexities of the WUI requires a convergent, multidisciplinary approach to improve understanding of wildland fire, which can inform risk management and response, adaptation and resilience across infrastructures, communities, cultures, and natural environments.
Considering impacts of wildland fire at the WUI in the context of global change, including demographics, ecosystems, land use and development, FIRE-WUI awards will support research that may for example:

Inform community adaptation and governance relevant to wildland fire;
Investigate public perceptions and understanding of wildland fire as well as decision making and communication and the resultant impact on livelihoods and cultural heritage; 
Promote better understanding of the socioeconomic disparities related to the impacts of wildfire on remote rural communities;
Test and model behaviors of building materials, structures, and infrastructures under wildfire loads;
Develop novel materials, methods, and technologies for retrofitting existing buildings and remediating buildings following wildfire and smoke events;
Create robust wildfire risk scenarios and algorithms for evaluating cascading failures and community-scale vulnerability.

Focus area 3: Fire Science Innovations through Research and Education (FIRE) Networks (FIRE-NET)
FIRE-Network projects will build new collaborative teams to synthesize aspects of wildland fire science and develop strategies for tackling key gaps. These networks will advance wildland fire research, or create new directions in research or education by supporting groups of investigators to communicate and coordinate their research, training, and educational activities across disciplinary, organizational, geographic, and international boundaries. Exchanging knowledge and information across and among different groups is encouraged. Projects will provide opportunities to foster new collaborations, including those with international partners where appropriate, and will address interdisciplinary knowledge and data exchange focused on wildland fire research and education.
Successful FIRE-NET conference proposals are encouraged to include but are not limited to the following types of activities:

Leveraging existing and developing data resources to support the development of new wildland fire-related research directions and educational activities;
Employing novel networking strategies and collaborative training technologies to enhance coordination among a variety of fields and knowledge holders;
Developing community standards for data and meta- data use and management in wildland fire research;
Developing mechanisms to share information and ideas, such as bringing together disparate data sources including Earth observation data;
Advancing wildland fire-related science and education through communication, data analysis, ideas sharing, novel collaborations, and workforce development.   

Particular areas of interest for FIRE-NETs include developing partnerships among groups that are not currently working together that might include multiple sectors, such as scientists from various disciplines, government representatives, resource managers, operational organizations, and community members. Small to large scale conference proposals that bring together different parts of the community to build a highly-functioning team are encouraged.",,"2025-06-20, 2025-06-20",,506410,pd25345Y,Cleared,2025-03-13,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/fire-fire-science-innovations-through-research-education/pd25-345y,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/policies/pappg
"Infrastructure Systems and People (ISP)","Infrastructure systems comprise complex connections between physical components, organizational structures and operational methods that support the needs of people and communities at the local, regional, national, and global scales.  Such systems form the backbone of society, providing essential services as well as ensuring public health and welfare, economic prosperity and national security, and are expected to function under all operational conditions. 
 
Meanwhile, infrastructure systems are capital intensive and vulnerable to disruptions from extreme events, including natural disasters, social crises, and malicious attacks. Disruptions in one system can have cascading impacts on others in space and over time. Moreover, short- versus long-term trade-offs, unintended consequences, and maladaptation are not often accounted for. How systems function at the “extreme,” which can be due to disruptors from the introduction of innovation, the convergence of technologies, sudden changes to their utilization and access, dramatic changes in operating environments, and changes to demand during crises are of particular interest. To ensure the efficiency, sustainability, and resilience, and user-equity of infrastructure systems, it is important to continuously improve and optimize their design, operations, system monitoring and performance assessment in dynamic, uncertain and sometime unknown environments. While functioning at extremes is of interest, the program also supports infrastructure systems research under the full range of operating conditions, across a variety of hazards, and in urban, suburban, and rural communities.
 
The program particularly encourages interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary exploration that will open new research frontiers and significantly broaden and transform relevant research communities. The program welcomes research that addresses novel system integration, user-inspired system and service design, data analytics, and socio-technical studies focused on engineering and system innovation during normal and extreme conditions. The program also values innovative research efforts focused on collecting, standardizing, and sharing large-scale databases of real-world infrastructure systems and people-infrastructure interactions during normal and extreme operating conditions, which can be instrumental in providing benchmarks for model verification and validationand for advancing future research innovation in ISP.  
 
The ISP program supports research on lifeline systems and communities that contributes to the National Science Foundation’s role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). Principal Investigators are encouraged to leverage NSF’s investments in the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) experimental, computational modeling and simulation, and data resources (https://www.designsafe-ci.org/) in their research to accelerate advances needed for reducing the impacts of natural hazards on infrastructures and people.
 
While physics-based subject-matter knowledge may be crucial in many research efforts, the program does not support research whose primary methodological contribution focuses on individual infrastructure components without a systems research perspective whose primary methodological focus is on geotechnical and structural engineering, material sciences, architectural engineering, wireless communication and sensor technology, human factors, and/or hydrologic or environmental engineering.
 
Proposers are actively encouraged to email a one-page project summary to the ISP Program Officers before submitting a full proposal for guidance on whether the proposed research topic falls within the scope of the ISP program; this guidance should especially be requested for multi-disciplinary research proposals, and proposals for which research and/or development on the subject infrastructure(s) are also supported by other federal and/or state agencies.",,,1,506398,pd25342Y,Cleared,2025-01-24,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/isp-infrastructure-systems-people/pd25-342y,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/policies/pappg

The second goal is to advance or move specific practice, research or scientific discovery in STEM education reciprocally along the research-practice continuum.
The Translation and Diffusion (TD) solicitation invites four types of proposals: Research on Translation or Diffusion proposals request funding to conduct scholarship that will advance the sciences of translation or diffusion of fundamental research knowledge toward PreK-12 formal STEM education practice by developing or refining theories, frameworks, or models (or adapting those from other domains) and conducting related research. Such proposals may also address the leveraging of effective classroom practices toward the enrichment of foundational research, constructs and models. We note that bi-directional movement across boundaries is a mutually beneficial reciprocal process. Proof-of-Concept Research proposals request funding to explore the feasibility and viability of particular knowledge or products generated from STEM education research toward advancing practice in formal PreK-12 settings (even if it is still basic or applied research and development rather than implementation). The goals are to facilitate the process by which the promise that the initial insight holds for research and practice can be realized. The outcome of such a project would lay the methodological, theoretical, empirical, design, or social foundation for conducting systematic work at the next stage of development or at the next level of analysis. Empirical and theory-building efforts to adapt initial insights from research or practice across significantly different contexts, populations, domains, and levels-of-analysis are also welcome. Synthesis proposals critically integrate the current state of knowledge on a particular topic relevant to translation and diffusion in formal PreK-12 STEM education. Such proposals should include the state of the knowledge across disciplinary communities and across relevant literatures, identify the lacunae in STEM education knowledge, and, where appropriate, lay out the next steps for future research and development. Conference / Workshop proposals relevant to the call are also welcome.","standard, continuing","2026-02-04, 2026-02-04",,506386,nsf25528,Cleared,2024-12-20,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/td-translation-diffusion/nsf25-528,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/td-translation-diffusion/nsf25-528/solicitation

"Materials Innovation Platforms (MIP)","Materials Innovation Platforms (MIP) is a mid-scale infrastructure program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) designed to accelerate advances in materials research. MIPs respond to the increasing complexity of materials research that requires close collaboration of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary teams and access to cutting edge tools. These tools in a user facility benefit both a user program and in-house research, which focus on addressing grand challenges of fundamental science and meet national needs. MIPs embrace the paradigm set forth by the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), which strives to “discover, manufacture, and deploy advanced materials twice as fast, at a fraction of the cost,” and conduct research through iterative “closed-loop” efforts among the areas of materials synthesis/processing, materials characterization, and theory/modeling/simulation. In addition, they are expected to engage the emerging field of data science in materials research. Each MIP is a scientific ecosystem, which includes in-house research scientists, external users and other scientists who, collectively, form a community of practitioners and share tools, codes, samples, data and know-how. The knowledge sharing is designed to strengthen collaborations among scientists and enable them to work in new ways, fostering new modalities of research and training, for the purpose of accelerating discovery and development of new materials and novel materials phenomena/properties, as well as fostering their eventual deployment.
The scientific focus of the MIP program is subject to change from competition to competition. Information about the existing MIPs, from two previous competitions in 2015 and 2019, can be found at mip.org.

"Security, Privacy, and Trust in Cyberspace (SaTC 2.0)","Our world is at a pivotal moment where the boundaries dividing the physical and social worlds from the cyber world have become blurred. Cyberspace has evolved from an interconnected digital environment into a complex and interdependent cyber ecosystem that involves hardware, software, networks, data, people, organizations, countries, and the physical world.  Critical functions of everyday life are deeply intertwined with computing, including health, government, commerce, the public sphere, education, critical infrastructure, interpersonal communication, and transportation. The complexity and inter-dependencies in cyberspace can be misused and exploited by malicious actors. These in turn can trigger adverse outcomes such as disruption of critical infrastructure and systems; theft of intellectual property and sensitive data; amplification of inequalities; disclosure of private information of individuals, organizations, and governments; and threats to lives, livelihoods, and reputations. Furthermore, constant attacks on the data and assets of corporations, governments, and individuals undermine people’s trust in decision-making and processes that depend critically on these cyber systems.  
The Security, Privacy, and Trust in Cyberspace (SaTC 2.0) program aims to build trust in global cyber ecosystems. Trust is the core tenet of this program and, for the purposes of this solicitation, is broadly defined to include our confidence in the security, privacy, and resilience of cyberspace, particularly in the face of malicious intent. Achieving this level of confidence in cyberspace requires not only understanding the vulnerabilities in a system that could be exploited and how they can be addressed, but also understanding the social and technical dimensions of trust in cyber systems, along with the educational efforts needed to increase public awareness of risks in cyberspace, and building a well-trained corps of privacy and security professionals.
SaTC 2.0 spans the interests of NSF's Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), and STEM Education (EDU).

"Experiential Learning for Emerging and Novel Technologies (ExLENT)","Through this initiative, the Directorate for STEM Education (EDU) and the  Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), in partnership with Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) through the Micron Foundation, seek to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals from all professional and educational backgrounds, resulting in increased access to, and interest in, career pathways in emerging technology fields (e.g., advanced manufacturing, advanced wireless, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, quantum information science, semiconductors, and microelectronics). As NSF seeks to support the development of technologies in such fields, similar support will be needed to foster and grow a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce comprising and enabling all Americans to contribute to such innovation. Large-scale challenges like advances in microelectronics or artificial intelligence also require a STEM workforce that brings varied perspectives and expertise to further accelerate the translation of science and engineering discoveries into large-scale solutions. Moreover, as current and new emerging technologies continue to evolve, unforeseen issues around security, safety and privacy will impact the preparation of the workforce. Emerging technologies are also dynamic and rapidly changing, with career entry and advancement often requiring ""learning-by-doing"" experience, even for those with some STEM education. Therefore, NSF recognizes that a competitive emerging technology workforce must include individuals from traditional and nontraditional education pathways as well as those individuals who may have “stopped” out of traditional educational pathways.
The ExLENT program will support experiential learning opportunities designed to provide cohorts of learners with the crucial skills needed to succeed in emerging technology fields and prepare them to enter the workforce ready to solve our Nation’s most pressing challenges. Furthermore, the ExLENT program will directly support NSF’s priority to enable all Americans the opportunity to become a part of the emerging technologies workforce1, thereby assuring the Nation’s competitiveness in STEM.    
Key goals of the program are to (1) expand access to career-enhancing experiential learning opportunities for all individuals, including adult learners interested in re-skilling and/or upskilling (e.g., those who face or who have faced significant barriers to accessing a formal STEM education); (2) promote cross-sector partnerships between organizations in emerging technology fields and those with expertise in workforce development; and (3) develop a workforce aligned with regional economies based on emerging technologies across the Nation, in alignment with the mission of the TIP Directorate.

"Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF)","DMREF seeks to foster the design, discovery, and development of materials to accelerate their path to deployment by harnessing the power of data and computational tools in concert with experiment and theory. DMREF emphasizes a deep integration of experiments, computation, and theory; the use of accessible digital data across the materials development continuum; and strengthening connections among theorists, computational scientists, data scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, and experimentalists as well as those from academia, industry, and government. DMREF is committed to the education and training of a next-generation materials research and development (R&D) workforce; well-equipped for successful careers as educators and innovators; and able to take full advantage of the materials development continuum and innovation infrastructures that NSF is creating through partnership with other federal and international agencies.
DMREF is the principal NSF program responsive to the National Science and Technology Council’s (NSTC’s) Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Subcommittee on the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI). Over its inaugural decade, the MGI has driven a transformational paradigm shift in the philosophy of how materials research is performed. DMREF is supportive of the 2021 MGI Strategic Plan and its three primary goals, i.e., unifying the materials innovation infrastructure; harnessing the power of materials data; and educating, training, and connecting a world-class materials R&D workforce. 
DMREF will accordingly support activities that significantly accelerate the materials discovery-to-use timeline by building the fundamental knowledge base needed to advance the design, development, or manufacturability of materials with desirable properties or functionality. The 2021 MGI Strategic Plan re-envisioned the linear Materials Development Continuum described in the original Strategic Plan to promote integration and iteration of knowledge across the entire path to deployment. DMREF will undertake this challenge through building a vibrant research community, forming interdisciplinary teams to conduct research in a “closed-loop” fashion, leveraging data science and machine learning, providing ready access to materials data, and educating the future MGI workforce.
This solicitation is open to all materials research topics and is responsive to the recent National Academies 2023 Report ‘NSF Efforts to Achieve the Nation’s Vision for the Materials Genome Initiative’. DMREF reflects the Administration’s priorities for strengthening American leadership in technologies and industries of the future that are critical to the nation’s health, economic prosperity, national security, and scientific enterprise.
DMREF encourages input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer which includes underrepresented and underserved communities. Aligning with Goal 3 of the 2021 MGI Strategic Plan, DMREF promotes education, training, and workforce development that can communicate across all components of the materials development continuum.
Proposals submitted to this solicitation must be directed by a team of at least two Senior/Key Personnel with complementary expertise. The proposed research must involve a collaborative and iterative “closed-loop” process wherein theory guides computational simulation, computational simulation guides experiments, and experimental observation further guides theory.
This solicitation represents a crosscutting activity involving the Directorates for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), Engineering (ENG), Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE), and Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP). Additionally, partnership with other federal agencies may lead to an interagency effort. Submitted proposals may be shared with one or more federal partners in the solicitation: Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy (EERE), Office of Naval Research (ONR), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Ground Vehicle Systems Center (GVSC), and the DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory (ARL). Opportunities are also present for collaboration with the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF), India’s Department of Science and Technology (DST), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and Germany’s Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).

"Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences Program (HEGS)","The objective of the Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences Program is to support basic scientific research about the nature, causes, consequences, or evolution of the spatial dimensions of human behaviors, activities, and dynamics as well as their interactions with environmental and social processes across a range of scales. Contemporary geographical research encompasses diverse research traditions and methodologies. Recognizing the breadth of the field’s contributions to science, the HEGS Program welcomes proposals for empirically grounded, theoretically engaged, methodologically rigorous, and generalizable research that advances geographical and geospatial sciences.   

Because the National Science Foundation's mandate is to support fundamental scientific research, the HEGS program cannot fund research that takes as its primary goal humanistic interpretations or findings that are not generalizable or reproducible. HEGS welcomes proposals that utilize quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods in novel ways. However, a proposal that applies geographical or geospatial methods to a geographic problem without proposing how that problem provides an opportunity to make a theory-testing or theory-expanding contribution to geographical science, broadly defined, will be returned without review. HEGS supported projects are expected to yield results that will enhance, expand, and transform fundamental geographical theory and geospatial methods and that will have broader impacts that benefit society. 


Generally, successful HEGS proposals should describe clear and detailed plans for data collection (including sample selection if appropriate), justification for proposed methods, plans for data analysis, attention to confounding variables, and efforts to address biases (e.g., confirmatory biases, selection biases, etc.). Competitive HEGS proposals should substantiate the validity of findings and generalizability to broader contexts. 


It should be noted that HEGS is situated in the Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences Division of the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate at NSF. Therefore, it is critical that research projects submitted to the HEGS program illustrate how the proposed research questions engage human dimensions that are relevant and important to people and societies.

ECCS also supports new and emerging research areas encompassing 6G and Beyond Spectrum and Wireless Technologies, Quantum Information Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), High-Performance Computing, and Big Data.
ECCS, through its ASCENT program, offers its engineering community the opportunity to address research issues and answer engineering challenges associated with complex systems and networks that are not achievable by a single principal investigator or by short-term projects and can only be achieved by interdisciplinary research teams. ECCS envisions a connected portfolio of transformative and integrative projects that create synergistic links by investigators across its three ECCS clusters: Communications, Circuits, and Sensing-Systems (CCSS), Electronics, Photonics and Magnetic Devices (EPMD), and Energy, Power, Control, and Networks (EPCN), yielding novel ways of addressing challenges of engineering systems and networks. ECCS seeks proposals that are bold and ground-breaking, transcend the perspectives and approaches typical of disciplinary research efforts, and lead to disruptive technologies and methods or enable significant improvement in quality of life.

ASCENT supports fundamental research projects involving at least three collaborating PIs and co-PIs, up to four years in duration, with a total budget between $1 million and $1.5 million.
ASCENT proposals must highlight the engineering leadership focus of the proposal within the scope of ECCS programs.
ASCENT proposals must articulate a fundamental research problem with compelling intellectual challenge and significant societal impact. The topic at the heart of the proposal must involve research areas of at least two of the three ECCS clusters (CCSS, EPMD, EPCN). Research proposals spanning three clusters are highly encouraged.
ASCENT proposals must demonstrate the need for a concerted research effort by an integrated and interdisciplinary team, and strongly justify the interdisciplinary nature of the proposed work. They should include a timeline for research activities, with a strong justification of the explicit mechanisms for frequent communication between team members and effective assessment to achieve proposed goals.

"Cultural Anthropology Program Senior Research Awards (CA-SR)","The primary objective of the Cultural Anthropology Program is to support fundamental, systematic anthropological research and training to increase understanding of the causes, consequences and complexities of human social and cultural variability. The Cultural Anthropology Program welcomes proposals from researchers in all sub-fields of cultural anthropology and research at any temporal or spatial scale. Methodologies and approaches employed may include ethnographic field research, surveys, remote sensing, the collection of bio-markers, experimental research inside or outside of laboratory settings, archival research, the analysis of materials collections and extant data bases, mathematical and computational modeling and other research tools as appropriate for the proposed research. The overarching research goals should be to produce empirically grounded findings that will be generalizable beyond particular case studies and contribute to building a more robust anthropological science of human society and culture.
The U.S. National Science Foundation's mandate is to support basic scientific research. Basic research in cultural anthropology means theory-generating and theory-testing research that creates new knowledge about human culture and society. Therefore, the Cultural Anthropology Program cannot support research that takes as its primary objective improved clinical practice, applied policy or other immediate application. Research that seeks to advance scientific cultural anthropological theories in a way that advances use-inspired objectives may be supported, but the theory-advancing objectives must be clearly at the center of the proposal. A proposal to use anthropological methods and approaches only to find solutions to social, medical or other problems without specifically proposing to make a theory-testing or theory-expanding contribution to anthropological science will be returned without review.","standard, continuing","2025-08-15, 2025-08-15",,505513,nsf25502,Cleared,2024-10-07,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ca-sr-cultural-anthropology-program-senior-research-awards/nsf25-502,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ca-sr-cultural-anthropology-program-senior-research-awards/nsf25-502/solicitation

"Safety, Security, and Privacy of Open-Source Ecosystems (Safe-OSE)","Vulnerabilities in an open-source product and/or its continuous development, integration and deployment infrastructure can potentially be exploited to attack any user (human, organization, and/or another product/entity) of the product. To respond to the growing threats to the safety, security, and privacy of open-source ecosystems (OSEs), NSF is launching the Safety, Security, and Privacy for Open-Source Ecosystems (Safe-OSE) program. This program solicits proposals from OSEs, including those not originally funded by NSF’s Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program, to address significant safety, security, and/or privacy vulnerabilities, both technical (e.g., vulnerabilities in code and side-channels) and socio-technical (e.g., supply chain, insider threats, and social engineering). 
Although most open-source products are software-based, it is important to note that Safe-OSE applies to any type of OSE, including those based on scientific methodologies, models, and processes; manufacturing processes and process specifications; materials formulations; programming languages and formats; hardware instruction sets; system designs or specifications; and data platforms. The goal of the Safe-OSE program is to catalyze meaningful improvements in the safety, security, and privacy of the targeted OSE that the OSE does not currently have the resources to undertake. Funds from this program should be directed toward efforts to enhance the safety, security, and privacy characteristics of the open-source product and its supply chain as well as to bolster the ecosystem’s capabilities for managing current and future risks, attacks, breaches, and responses.",coop,"2025-04-22, 2025-04-22",,506343,nsf24608,Cleared,2024-09-19,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems/nsf24-608,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems/nsf24-608/solicitation

"Multilateral Partnerships Leveraging Excellence (MultiPLEx)","Many of the most pressing challenges in research and innovation require collaboration across national and disciplinary boundaries to achieve important advances. A growing number of topics are best addressed on a multilateral basis, building partnerships that leverage diverse expertise, data, infrastructure, and perspectives to advance understanding on critical topics of regional or global importance. At the same time, funders, research organizations, and researchers alike typically have limited experience with multilateral partnerships.  
The Office of International Science and Engineering’s MultiPLEx program seeks to support visionary, and ambitious international multilateral research partnerships that are required to hasten progress in addressing grand challenges by leveraging research excellence in the U.S. and around the globe. The program also seeks to advance understanding of effective multilateral collaboration.
MultiPLEx  welcomes proposals that

Address urgent research and/or societal challenge of global importance (including but not limited to critical and emerging technology research) and require an inherently international multilateral approach to achieve impactful research results, partnering with at least two countries other than the U.S. Proposals that engage partners across distinct geographic regions are an area of interest.
Make clear how the proposed international collaboration will enable research advances and broader impacts that go beyond what can be accomplished by a narrower team.
Include a diverse group of U.S. institutions and/or individuals, leveraging the full range of talent that society has to offer

MultiPLEx funds support the U.S. research team. Research partners should seek funding from their own national funding agencies or from other sources. A typical MultiPLEx award will be up to three years in duration.   
The MultiPLEX program is not intended to replace existing OISE or directorate programs. Proposals submitted to MultiPLEX must fall outside the scope of existing OISE or directorate programs.  Any proposal submitted to MultiPLEx that is not responsive to this Program Description may be transferred to another OISE program or returned without review.
OISE may periodically issue a Dear Colleague Letter inviting MultiPLEx proposals in specific priority areas. PIs interested in submitting proposals that do not respond to a DCL are strongly encouraged to consult a MultiPLEx program director prior to submission to confirm appropriateness. Unless specified in a DCL, MultiPLEx proposals may be submitted any time.","standard, continuing",,1,506365,pd247298,Cleared,2024-09-13,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/multiplex-multilateral-partnerships-leveraging-excellence/pd24-7298,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/policies/pappg
"Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE)","The Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program aims to harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance. Many NSF-funded projects result in publicly accessible, modifiable, and distributable open-source products, including software, hardware, models, specifications, programming languages, or data platforms that catalyze further innovation. In some cases, an open-source product that shows potential for wide adoption forms the basis for a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (OSE) that comprises a leadership team; a managing organization with a well-defined governance structure and distributed development model; a cohesive community of external intellectual content developers; and a broad base of users across academia, industry, and/or government. The overarching vision of POSE is that proactive and intentional formation of managing organizations will ensure broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products; increased coordination of external intellectual content developer contributions; and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact. Toward this end, the POSE program supports the formation of new OSE managing organizations based on an existing open-source product or class of products, whereby each organization is responsible for the creation and management of processes and infrastructure needed for the efficient and secure development and maintenance of an OSE.
POSE constitutes a new pathway to translate scientific innovations, akin to the Lab-to-Market Platform that NSF has pioneered over many decades. Whereas programs like the NSF Innovation Corps (NSF I-Corps™) and America’s Seed Fund [Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)] represent an integrated set of programs to provide researchers with the capacity to transform their fundamental research into deep technology ventures, POSE is specifically focused on another translational pathway – supporting the transition from open-source research artifacts to OSEs.
Importantly, the POSE program is not intended to fund the development of open-source products, including tools and artifacts. The POSE program is also not intended to fund existing well-resourced, open-source communities or ecosystems. Instead, the program aims to support new managing organizations to catalyze distributed, community-driven development and growth of new OSEs. The expected outcomes of the POSE program are to grow the community of researchers and innovators who develop and contribute to OSE efforts, and to enable pathways for the safe and secure development of OSEs that have broad societal impacts. OSEs can emerge from any areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) research and development.
This solicitation seeks two types of proposals, allowing teams to propose specific activities to scope and plan the establishment of an OSE (Phase I), and to establish a sustainable OSE based on a robust open-source product that shows promise in the ability to both meet an emergent societal or national need and build a community to help develop it (Phase II).
Phase I: OSE Scoping and Planning Proposals
Phase I projects are for open-source research products with a small community of external users though the product may not necessarily have external content developers. The objectives of Phase I projects are to: (1) enable scoping activities that will inform the transition of promising research products that are already available in open-source formats into sustainable and robust OSEs that will have broad societal impacts, and (2) provide training to teams interested in building such an OSE.
Phase I awardees are not obligated to submit Phase II proposals in the future. 
Phase II: Establishment and Expansion Proposals
Phase II projects are for open-source research products with small, existing communities of external users and external content developers. The objective of Phase II projects is to support the transition of a promising open-source product into a sustainable and robust OSE. Phase II proposal teams are expected to have already conducted the scoping activities needed to develop a detailed project plan to support the community-driven distributed development and deployment of successful open-source tools into operational environments (not necessarily via a Phase I award). 
An NSF POSE Phase I award is not required for the submission of a Phase II proposal.","standard, continuing","2025-09-02, 2025-09-02",,505982,nsf24606,Cleared,2024-09-13,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pose-pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems/nsf24-606,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pose-pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems/nsf24-606/solicitation

"Cultural Anthropology Program - Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (CA-DDRIG)","The primary objective of the Cultural Anthropology Program is to support basic scientific research on the causes, consequences and complexities of human social and cultural variability.
Contemporary cultural anthropology is an arena in which diverse research traditions and methodologies are valid in investigations of human cultural variation. Recognizing the breadth of the field's contributions to science, the Cultural Anthropology Program welcomes proposals for empirically grounded, fieldwork/lab-based theoretically engaged and methodologically sophisticated research in all sub-fields of cultural anthropology. Because the National Science Foundation's mission is to support basic research, the NSF Cultural Anthropology Program does not fund research that takes as its primary goal improved clinical practice, humanistic understanding or applied policy. A proposal that applies anthropological methods to a social problem but does not propose how that problem provides an opportunity to make a theory-testing and/or theory-expanding contribution to anthropology will be returned without review.
Program research priorities include, but are not limited to, research that increases our understanding of:

Sociocultural drivers of critical anthropogenic processes such as deforestation, desertification, land cover change, urbanization and poverty.
Resilience and robustness of sociocultural systems.
Scientific principles underlying conflict, cooperation and altruism, as well as explanations of variation in culture, norms, behaviors and institutions.
Economy, culture, migration and globalization.
Variability and change in kinship and family norms and practices.
General cultural and social principles underlining the drivers of health outcomes and disease transmission.
Biocultural work that considers the nexus of human culture and its relationship with human biology.
Social regulation, governmentality and violence.
Origins of complexity in sociocultural systems.
Language and culture: orality and literacy, sociolinguistics and cognition.
Theoretically-informed approaches to co-production in relation to scientific understandings of human variability and environmental stewardship.
Mathematical and computational models of sociocultural systems such as social network analysis, agent-based models, multi-level models, and modes that integrate agent-based simulations and geographic information systems (GIS).
Socio-cultural drivers of technology and technological systems such as AI, machine learning, augmented data, and platforms.

"Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-1 (Mid-scale RI-1)","NSF-supported science and engineering research increasingly relies on cutting-edge infrastructure. With its Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and Major Multi-user Facilities (""Major Facilities"") projects, NSF supports infrastructure projects at the lower and higher range of infrastructure project costs, Foundation-wide, across science and engineering research disciplines. The Foundation-wide Mid-scale Research Infrastructure opportunity is intended to provide NSF with an agile, Foundation-wide process to fund experimental research capabilities in the mid-scale range between MRI and Major Multi-user Facilities.
NSF defines Research Infrastructure (RI) as any combination of facilities, equipment, instrumentation, or computational hardware or software, and the necessary human capital in support of the same. Major facilities and mid-scale projects are subsets of research infrastructure. The NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-1 Program (Mid-scale RI-1) supports either design activities or implementation of unique and compelling RI projects. Mid-scale implementation projects may include any combination of equipment, instrumentation, cyberinfrastructure, broadly used large scale datasets and the personnel needed to successfully commission the project. Mid-scale RI-1 design activities include the design efforts intended to lead to eventual implementation of a mid-scale class RI project. Mid-scale RI-1 projects should involve the training of a diverse workforce engaged in the design and implementation of STEM research infrastructure. Mid-scale RI-1 projects should directly enable advances in any of the research domains supported by NSF. Projects may also include upgrades to existing research infrastructure. 
Mid-scale RI-1 emphasizes strong scientific merit, a response to an identified need of the research community and/or fulfillment of a national need to enable U.S. researchers to be competitive in a global research environment. Well-conceived technical and management plans are essential for both design and implementation proposals, as are well-developed plans (e.g., mentoring and professional development) for student training and the involvement of a diverse STEM workforce in all aspects of mid-scale design and/or implementation activities. The inclusion of individual project participants that will lead to a supportive working environment is especially encouraged at all levels of the project team.
Within Mid-scale RI-1, proposers may submit two types of projects, “Implementation” (e.g., acquisition and/or construction) or “Design”. The “Design” track is intended to facilitate progress toward readiness for a mid-scale range implementation project. Both Implementation projects and Design activities may involve new or upgraded research infrastructure. Mid-scale RI-1 ""Implementation"" projects may have a total project cost ranging from $4 million up to but not including $20 million. Mid-scale RI-1 ""Design"" activities may request less than $4 million, with a minimum request of $400,000 and a maximum request up to but not including $20 million, as appropriate, to prepare for a future mid-scale range implementation project. Note: Successful award of a Mid-scale RI-1 design activity does not imply NSF's commitment to the future implementation of the project being designed, nor is a Mid-scale RI-1 design award required for the submission of an implementation project.
The Mid-scale RI-1 Program seeks to broaden the representation of PIs and institutions in its award portfolio, including a geographically diverse set of institutions (especially those in EPSCoR jurisdictions). Proposals submitted by, or involving partnerships between institutions are encouraged. Participation in this opportunity is encouraged for the full spectrum of diverse talent society has to offer to include PIs who are women, early-career researchers, persons with disabilities, or members of other groups underrepresented in STEM. To improve participation in science and engineering research for persons with disabilities, Mid-scale RI-1 encourages PIs to incorporate accessibility as part of Mid-scale RI-1 design activity and implementation projects.
Please consult NSF's Research Infrastructure Guide, or RIG (available at https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/lfo/lfo_documents.jsp), for definitions of certain terms used in this solicitation, such as the Project Execution Plan (PEP) and Design and Execution Plan (DEP). The RIG provides guidance specific to Mid-scale Research Infrastructure Projects, including references to other parts of the RIG as needed. Note that PEP or DEP should be appropriately scaled for the complexity of the project and may not require all of the elements described in the RIG.
Mid-scale research infrastructure projects with total project costs beyond the Mid-scale RI-1 Program limit are separately solicited through the Mid-scale RI-2 Program. Proposals to the Mid-scale RI-1 Program with total project costs outside of this solicitation's budgetary limits, either during initial submission or after cost analyses/revisions during subsequent review, are subject to return without further review. ","standard, continuing, coop","2025-06-05, 2025-06-05",,505602,nsf24598,Cleared,2024-08-16,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/mid-scale-ri-1-mid-scale-research-infrastructure-1/nsf24-598,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/mid-scale-ri-1-mid-scale-research-infrastructure-1/nsf24-598/solicitation
"Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E)","Large-scale simulations and the ability to accumulate massive amounts of data have revolutionized science and engineering. The goal of the Computational and Data-enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) meta-program is to identify and capitalize on opportunities for major scientific and engineering breakthroughs through new computational and data-analysis approaches and best practices. The CDS&E meta-program supports projects that harness computation and data to advance knowledge and accelerate discovery above and beyond the goals of the participating individual programs. The intellectual drivers may be in an individual discipline or cut across more than one discipline in various Divisions and Directorates. A CDS&E proposal should enable and/or utilize the development and adaptation of advances in research and infrastructure in computational and data science.
The CDS&E meta-program encourages research that pushes the envelope of science and engineering through computation and data, welcoming proposals in any research area supported by the participating divisions. A proposal may address topics that develop or enable interactions among theory, computing, experiment, and observation to achieve progress on hitherto intractable science and engineering problems. Areas of emphasis for CDS&E vary by program. PIs are advised to consult the ""related programs"" links below before submitting.
The CDS&E meta-program is not intended to replace existing programs that support projects involving computation or the analysis of large or complex data sets using established methods. Rather, proposals submitted to the CDS&E meta-program must have a significant component of computational or data science that goes well beyond what would typically be included in these programs. Any proposal submitted to the CDS&E program that is not responsive to this Program Description may be transferred to or reviewed within the context of an individual program. A proposal requesting consideration within the context of CDS&E should begin the title with the identifying acronym ""CDS&E:"". Supplement requests to existing awards may also be considered. A CDS&E proposal should include substantive science, engineering, or computing research. Algorithm and pilot software development supporting science and engineering may also be appropriate, depending on the program. Proposers who seek to implement proven, existing methods into robust cyberinfrastructure are referred instead to the program on Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI).
A CDS&E proposal should be submitted to one of the ""Related Programs"" or Divisions by the associated submission window, deadline, or target date listed in the table below. In picking the most relevant program, PIs are advised to read program descriptions and solicitations carefully and consult with cognizant Program Officers before proposal preparation. Proposal submissions outside the receiving program's scientific scope may be transferred to a different program or returned without review.

"Regional Resilience Innovation Incubator (R2I2)","The Regional Resilience Innovation Incubators (R2I2) is a cross-directorate NSF solicitation led by the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) and the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP). R2I2 will support community- engaged team science to co-design high-impact solutions to climate-related societal challenges that leverage recent advances in fundamental climate change and Earth system science research. Each R2I2 project will address specific regional climate challenges and will develop and demonstrate solutions to those challenges that can be effectively applied in real- world settings. Investment in R2I2 will leverage past federal investments in addressing climate change and will provide a bridge connecting advancements in basic science with local knowledge, informed decision making, and technological innovations for societal applications.
R2I2 will be implemented in two phases, concept creation and implementation. This solicitation, focused on Phase-1, will fund a series of pilot projects focusing on project concept creation and refinement for solutions specific to a U.S. climate region.
Targeted areas for establishing R2I2 incubators will be based on ten climate regions defined by the Fifth National Climate Assessment (Table 1.1): Northeast, Southeast, U.S. Caribbean, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, Southern Great Plains, Northwest, Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaii & U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands. Although geographic diversity will be a factor considered when determining the portfolio of awards, the review process may result in funding multiple projects in one climate region and none in others. Individual R2I2 projects may propose solutions that apply to more than one climate region defined above. This solicitation will also fund an award for the creation of a R2I2 National Office (RNO) to support the collective and coordinated implementation of R2I2 award activities.

NSF envisions the release of a separate solicitation for Phase-2 implementation projects in fiscal year 2026, subject to the availability of funds. Only Phase-1 award recipients will be eligible to submit Phase-2 proposals. Phase-2 awards will be selected based on a merit review of Phase-2 proposals and performance during Phase-1.","standard, continuing, coop",,,506269,nsf24595,Cleared,2024-08-08,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/r2i2-regional-resilience-innovation-incubator/nsf24-595,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/r2i2-regional-resilience-innovation-incubator/nsf24-595/solicitation
"Science and Technology Centers: Integrative Partnerships","The Science and Technology Centers (STC): Integrative Partnerships program supports exceptionally innovative, complex research and education projects that require large-scale, long-term awards. STCs focus on creating new scientific paradigms, establishing entirely new scientific disciplines, and developing transformative technologies which have the potential for broad scientific or societal impact. STCs conduct world-class research through partnerships among institutions of higher education, national laboratories, industrial organizations, other public or private entities, and via international collaborations, as appropriate. They provide a means to undertake potentially groundbreaking investigations at the interfaces of disciplines and/or highly innovative approaches within disciplines. STCs may involve any area of science and engineering that NSF supports. STC investments support the NSF vision of creating and exploiting new concepts in science and engineering and providing global leadership in research and education.
Centers provide a rich environment for encouraging scientists, engineers, and educators to take risks in pursuing discoveries and new knowledge. STCs foster excellence in education by integrating education and research, and by creating connections between learning and inquiry so that discovery and creativity fully support the learning process.
NSF encourages input and participation in the STC program from the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer which includes underrepresented and underserved communities.  In addition, NSF expects STCs to both involve individuals who are members of groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in science, engineering and mathematics at all levels within the Center (faculty, staff, students, and postdoctoral researchers) as well as be a leader in broadening participation in STEM.  Centers may use either proven or innovative mechanisms based on the relevant literature to address matters such as recruitment, retention, success, and career progression of all individuals in the Center.
Along with research, education and broadening participation, Centers must undertake activities that facilitate knowledge transfer, i.e., the exchange of scientific and technical information with the objective of disseminating and utilizing knowledge broadly in multiple sectors. Examples of knowledge transfer include technology transfer, providing key information to public policy-makers, or dissemination of knowledge from one field of science to another.

"NSF National Quantum Virtual Laboratory - Quantum Testbeds (NQVL)","The National Quantum Initiative (NQI) Act1 aims to ensure the continuing leadership of the United States (U.S.) in quantum information science and technology. In conformance with the NQI goals, an argument2-5 was set forth for a renewed emphasis on identifying and fostering early adoption of quantum technologies to transform the field of Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) and to accelerate broader impacts on society. A systematic approach to maturing quantum technology platforms by integrating end-users and potential customers from other fields of science and engineering and other sectors of the economy into cycles of research, development, and demonstration should lower the barriers for end-users to pioneer new applications. NSF support for use-inspired and translational research in QISE, combined with continued strong support of the underlying foundational research, is anticipated to accelerate development of a market for quantum technologies.
With this program solicitation, the Foundation is taking the next step in implementing the National Quantum Virtual Laboratory (NQVL) concept as an overarching shared infrastructure designed to facilitate the translation from basic science and engineering to the resultant technology, while at the same time emphasizing and advancing its scientific and technical value. The NQVL aims to develop and utilize use-inspired and application-oriented quantum technologies. In the process, NQVL researchers will explore quantum frontiers6, foster the development of QISE education and workforce development strategies, engage in outreach activities at all levels, and promote input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent in QISE, thereby lowering barriers at all entry points of the research enterprise. Engagement with all sectors of the United States (U.S.) QISE community will be necessary for this initiative to succeed, and, indeed, the project is designed to include participation from a full spectrum of organizations who have expertise to contribute. In particular, NSF recognizes that the involvement of industry partners is essential and will welcome these to be a part of the overall structure. Partnerships with other U.S. Federal agencies under the NQI umbrella are also encouraged.
While this solicitation lays out the vision for the entire NQVL program that includes Quantum Science and Technology Demonstration (QSTD) projects, support for enabling technologies through Transformative Advances in Quantum Systems (TAQS), as well as a central coordination hub, only proposals for Design- and Implementation-phase QSTDs are solicited at this time.
Submission of a QSTD:Design proposal is contingent upon the existence of a QSTD:Pilot project in the same topical area, and the positive recommendation from the Conceptual Design Review of the QSTD:Pilot project. The QSTD:Design project builds on progress made in the QSTD:Pilot phase.
Submission of a QSTD:Implementation proposal is contingent upon the existence of a QSTD:Design project in the same topical area, and the positive recommendation from the Preliminary Design Review of the QSTD:Design project. The QSTD:Implementation project builds on progress made in the QSTD:Design phase.
It is required that prospective PIs contact the NQVL Program Officer(s) as soon as possible, but not later than two weeks before submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation, to ascertain that the focus and budget of their proposal is appropriate for this solicitation.

"Advanced Technological Education (ATE)","With a focus on two-year Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program supports the education of technicians for the high-technology fields that drive our nation's economy. The program involves partnerships between academic institutions (grades 7-12, IHEs), industry, and economic development agencies to promote improvement in the education of science and engineering technicians. It is strongly recommended that projects be faculty-led and required that courses and programs are credit-bearing, although materials developed may also be used for incumbent worker education. Materials may also be adapted and implemented as credit-bearing courses. The ATE program supports curriculum development; professional development of college faculty and secondary school teachers; career pathway development for both students and incumbent workers; and other activities including applied research projects that advance the knowledge base related to technician education.
The ATE program encourages partnerships with other entities that may impact technician education. For example, with

the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Manufacturing Extension Partnerships (MEPs) (http://www.nist.gov/mep/index.cfm) as applicable to support technician education programs and the industries they serve; and
Manufacturing USA Institutes (https://manufacturing.gov/) addressing workforce development issues.

The ATE program encourages proposals from Minority Serving Institutions as well as other institutions that support the recruitment, retention, and completion (certificate, degree, program) of the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer, which includes underrepresented and underserved communities, in STEM technician education programs that award associate degrees. ","standard, continuing","2025-10-02, 2025-10-02",,5464,nsf24584,Cleared,2024-06-21,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ate-advanced-technological-education/nsf24-584,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ate-advanced-technological-education/nsf24-584/solicitation
"Advanced Computing Systems & Services: Adapting to the Rapid Evolution of Science and Engineering Research 2.0","The intent of this solicitation is to request proposals from organizations who are willing to serve as resource providers within the NSF Advanced Computing Systems and Services (ACSS) program. Resource providers would (1) provide advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) resources in production operations to support the full range of computation, data-analysis, and AI research across all of science and engineering (S&E), and (2) enable democratized and equitable access to the proposed resources. The current solicitation is intended to complement previous NSF investments in advanced computational infrastructure by provisioning resources, broadly defined in this solicitation to include systems and services, in two categories: 

Category I, Capacity Resources: production computational resources maximizing the capacity provided to support the broad range of computation, data analytics and AI needs in S&E research; and 
Category II, Innovative Prototypes/Testbeds: innovative forward-looking capabilities deploying novel technologies, architectures, usage modes, etc., and exploring new target applications, methods, and paradigms.

Resource Providers supported via this solicitation will be incorporated into NSF’s ACSS 2.0 program portfolio. This program complements investments in leadership-class computing and funds a federation of nationally available advanced computing resources that are technically diverse and intended to enable discoveries at a computational scale beyond the research of individual or regional academic institutions.  
NSF anticipates that at least 90% of the provisioned resource will be available to the S&E community through an open peer-reviewed national allocation process and have resource users be supported by community and other support services. Such allocation and support services are expected to be coordinated through the NSF-funded Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support (ACCESS) , the National AI Research Resource, or an NSF-approved alternative as may emerge. 
Provisioning novel, diverse computational resources nationally at scale will require capability and capacity to support researchers who need assistance to use these resources. User support may be provided via various means, e.g., training sessions, documentation, direct engagement in response to tickets created via the ACCESS program, or integration of novel, NSF-funded software tools.     
The ACSS 2.0 Program seeks broad representation of PIs across the full spectrum of diverse community talent (including the participation of groups that have traditional been underrepresented in the cyberinfrastructure community) and institutions (including those that have not historically provided nationally allocatable cyberinfrastructure) in both the community of resource recipients and resources users to continue growing the scale and diversity of the S&E community. Submission from or partnership with EPSCoR institutions and institutions that have not previously received ACSS awards is encouraged. ",coop,"2025-06-24, 2025-06-24",,503148,nsf24583,Cleared,2024-06-18,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/advanced-computing-systems-services-adapting-rapid-evolution/nsf24-583,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/advanced-computing-systems-services-adapting-rapid-evolution/nsf24-583/solicitation
"NSF Small Business Innovation Research / Small Business Technology Transfer Fast-Track Pilot Programs (SBIR-STTR Fast-Track)","The NSF SBIR/STTR and SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs support moving scientific excellence and technological innovation from the lab to the market. By funding startups and small businesses, NSF helps build a strong national economy and stimulates the creation of novel products, services, and solutions in private, public, or government sectors with potential for broad impact; strengthens the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs; increases the commercial application of federally supported research results; and develops and increases the US workforce, especially by fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses.
These NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs provide fixed amount cooperative agreements for the development of a broad range of technologies based on discoveries in science and engineering with potential for societal and economic impacts. Unlike fundamental or basic research activities that focus on scientific and engineering discovery itself, the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs support the creation of opportunities to move use-inspired and translational discoveries out of the lab and into the market or other use at scale, through startups and small businesses. The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs do not solicit specific technologies or procure goods and services from startups and small businesses. Any invention conceived or reduced to practice with the assistance of SBIR/STTR funding is subject to the Bayh-Dole Act. For more information refer to SBIR/STTR Frequently Asked Questions #75.   
NSF promotes inclusion by encouraging proposals from diverse populations and geographic locations.
The traditional NSF SBIR/STTR programs include two funding Phases – Phase I and Phase II. All proposers to the programs must first apply for Phase I funding – there is no direct-to-Phase II option. Under a traditional NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I award, a small business can receive non-dilutive funding for research and development (R&D) to demonstrate technical feasibility over 6 to 12 months and then, after completion of a Phase I project, companies may apply for Phase II funding to further develop the proposed technology. 
There are significant benefits for SBIR/STTR Fast-Track recipients: the submission of only one proposal for Phase I and Phase II and a faster transition from Phase I to Phase II. While startups and small businesses face many challenges, NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track funding is intended to specifically focus on challenges associated with technological innovation; that is, on the creation of new products, services, and other scalable solutions based on fundamental science or engineering. A successful Fast-Track proposal must demonstrate how NSF funding will help the small business create a proof-of-concept or prototype by retiring technical risk.
NSF seeks unproven, leading-edge, technology innovations that demonstrate the following characteristics:

The innovations are underpinned and enabled by a new scientific discovery or meaningful engineering innovation.
The innovations still require intensive technical research and development to be fully embedded in a reliable product or service.
The innovations have not yet been reduced to practice by anyone and it is not guaranteed, at present, that doing so is technically possible.
The innovations provide a strong competitive advantage that are not easily replicable by competitors (even technically proficient ones).
Once reduced to practice, the innovations are expected to result in a product or service that would either be disruptive to existing markets or create new markets/new market segments.

The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and start-ups by translating new scientific and engineering concepts into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits. The programs provide non-dilutive funding for research and development (R&D) of use-inspired scientific and engineering activities at the earliest stages of the company and technology development. During the course of the award, the emphasis is expected to shift from de-risking those aspects preventing the innovation from reaching technical feasibility and driving the intended impact to a greater focus on commercially relevant development activities that will allow the company to differentiate itself and drive new value propositions to the market and society.
NSF encourages input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer which includes underrepresented and underserved communities. 
These NSF programs are governed by 15 USC 638 and the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC §1861, et seq.).
Introduction to the Program
The NSF SBIR/STTR programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and startups by translating new scientific and engineering discoveries emerging from the private sector, federal labs, and academia into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits.
These NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs enable companies based on previous NSF awards (NSF award lineage) to submit a single proposal that, if awarded, can provide a faster pathway from Phase I to Phase II funding. Receipt of full funding under the Fast-Track pilot programs is contingent on the results of a company’s Phase II transition review.
The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs are part of the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), which was recently launched to accelerate innovation and enhance economic competitiveness by catalyzing partnerships and investments that strengthen the links between fundamental research and technology development, deployment, and use.",other,"2025-07-02, 2025-07-02",,506271,nsf24582,Cleared,2024-06-17,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/sbir-sttr-fast-track-nsf-small-business-innovation-research-small-business/nsf24-582,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/sbir-sttr-fast-track-nsf-small-business-innovation-research-small-business/nsf24-582/solicitation

"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)","Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that are built from, and depend upon, the seamless integration of computation and physical components. Advances in CPS will enable capability, adaptability, scalability, resiliency, safety, security, and usability that will expand the horizons of these critical systems. CPS technologies are transforming the way people interact with engineered systems, just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. New, smart CPS drive innovation and competition in a range of application domains including agriculture, aeronautics, building design, civil infrastructure, energy, environmental quality, healthcare and personalized medicine, manufacturing, and transportation. CPS are becoming data-rich enabling new and higher degrees of automation and autonomy. Traditional ideas in CPS research are being challenged by new concepts emerging from artificial intelligence and machine learning. The integration of artificial intelligence with CPS, especially for real-time operation, creates new research opportunities with major societal implications.
While tremendous progress has been made in advancing CPS technologies, the demand for innovation across application domains is driving the need to accelerate fundamental research to keep pace. At the same time, the CPS program seeks to open new vistas for the research community to think beyond the usual cyber-physical paradigms and structures and propose creative ideas to address the myriad challenges of today's systems as well as those of the future that have not yet been designed or fielded.
The CPS program aims to develop the core research needed to engineer these complex CPS, some of which may also require dependable, high-confidence, or provable behaviors. Core research areas of the program include control, data analytics, and machine learning including real-time learning for control, autonomy, design, Internet of Things (IoT), mixed initiatives including human-in- or human-on-the-loop, networking, privacy, real-time systems, safety, security, and verification. By abstracting from the particulars of specific systems and application domains, the CPS program seeks to reveal cross-cutting, fundamental scientific and engineering principles that underpin the integration of cyber and physical elements across all application domains. The program additionally supports the development of methods, tools, and hardware and software components based upon these cross-cutting principles, along with validation of the principles via prototypes and testbeds. This program also fosters a research community that is committed to advancing education and outreach in CPS and accelerating the transition of CPS research into the real world.
 All proposals must include the following as part of the Project Description:

A Research Description that describes the technical rationale and technical approach of the CPS research, including the challenges that drive the research problem and how the research integrates cyber and physical components. This section must also describe how the research outcomes are translational to other application domains. Specifically, it must include:

A subsection titled ""CPS Research Focus"" which describes the cyber-physical system attributes of the challenge problem and clearly identifies the core CPS research areas addressed in which the novel and foundational research contributions are being made. This is intended as not a list of core areas but a focused discussion with content


An Evaluation/Experimentation Plan that describes how proposed concepts will be validated and outlines the metrics for success;
A Project Management and Collaboration Plan that summarizes how the project team is ideally suited to realize the project goals and how the team will ensure effective collaboration;

NSF is working closely with multiple agencies across the federal government, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T); the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); and the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA, hereafter referred to as NIFA). 
Proposals for three classes of research and education projects—differing in scope and goals—are supported through the CPS program:

Small projects may request a total budget of up to $600,000 for a period of up to 3 years. They are well suited to emerging new and innovative ideas that may have high impact on the field of CPS. Small projects proposals may be submitted at anytime during the year-long annual submission window.
Medium projects may request a total budget ranging from $600,001 to $1,200,000 for a period of up to 3 years. They are well suited to multi-disciplinary projects that accomplish clear goals requiring integrated perspectives spanning the disciplines. Medium Projects proposals may be submitted at anytime during the year-long annual submission window.
Frontier projects must address clearly identified critical CPS challenges that cannot be achieved by a set of smaller projects. Furthermore, Frontier projects should also look to push the boundaries of CPS well beyond today's systems and capabilities. Funding may be requested for a total of $1,200,001 to $7,000,000 for a period of 4 to 5 years. Note that the Frontier projects have a specific deadline.

"Hispanic Serving Institutions: Equitable Transformation in STEM Education","Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) are an important component of the nation’s higher education ecosystem and play a critical role in realizing the National Science Board Vision Report for a more diverse and capable science and engineering workforce.  Aligned with this vision and the NSF Strategic Plan 2022 -2026 the goals of the NSF HSI Program are to:
1.     Enhance the quality of undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at HSIs.
2.     Increase the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students pursuing associate’s or baccalaureate degrees in STEM at HSIs.
Meeting these goals requires institutions to understand and embrace their students’ strengths, challenges, identities and lived experiences.  This can happen in many ways and across many areas of an institution. As such, the IUSE: HSI program provides multiple opportunities to support an institution’s goal to become more student centered, including the Equitable Transformation in STEM Education (ETSE) competition.   This competition includes the following tracks:
·       Departmental/Division Transformation Track (DDTT) - New
·       Institutional Transformation Track (ITT)
·       Emerging Faculty Research Track (EFRT) - New
·       HSI Program Resource Hubs (Hubs)
This solicitation will also accept conference proposals and planning proposals, as defined by the PAPPG.
The ETSE competition focuses on (1) institutional transformation projects that support HSIs in their effort to achieve equity in STEM education, and (2) the infrastructure—the HSI-Net network of resource hubs—which supports the overall program goals.
Institutions are encouraged to consider how their HSI designation, and their organizational mission align to better support STEM success of all students. The ETSE competition welcomes proposals that look to implement and evaluate promising practices and/or conduct research related to broadening participation or improving recruitment, retention, graduation, and other successful outcomes in STEM undergraduate education.
The ETSE solicitation supports projects designed to catalyze change and help HSIs meet students where they are, accounting for their assets and the challenges they may face. Identities and experiences are not determined solely by membership in a single monolithic population of students (e.g., Hispanic, first-generation, commuter, etc.). Consequently, institutions are expected to use institutional data to identify equity gaps, identify areas of need, and unpack the factors that shape students’ individual identities and shared experiences.  The perspectives gained from this data should be central to the design of the proposed project. 
Please see below for specific information about each track. While proposals are focused on mechanisms for transforming undergraduate STEM education, projects should also consider student voices and include mechanisms to aggregate and analyze existing student feedback and collect quantitative and qualitative student data throughout the life of the proposed project.","standard, continuing","2025-08-27, 2025-08-27",,506287,nsf24578,Cleared,2024-05-24,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/hispanic-serving-institutions-equitable-transformation-stem/nsf24-578,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/hispanic-serving-institutions-equitable-transformation-stem/nsf24-578/solicitation
"National STEM Teacher Corps Pilot Program","Synopsis of Program:
In response to the CHIPS Act of 2022 (Pub.L. 117-167), NSF is establishing the National STEM Teacher Corps Pilot Program. The purpose of this program is to elevate the profession of STEM teaching by establishing a National STEM Teacher Corps Pilot Program to recognize outstanding STEM teachers in our Nation’s classrooms, reward them for their accomplishments, elevate their public profile, and create rewarding career paths to which all STEM teachers can aspire, both to prepare future STEM researchers and to create a scientifically literate public.
With this solicitation, NSF is inviting proposals to establish an initial set of Regional Alliances responsible for (a) recruiting eligible applicants to become members of the National STEM Teacher Corps (see definitions in section II.A.); (b) screening, interviewing, and selecting members; and (c) supporting other activities detailed in the Program Description and the law (136 STAT. 1515).
Each Alliance will be awarded as a cooperative agreement that represents the breadth of activities important to National STEM Teacher Corps Pilot Program and serves to elevate the public profile of STEM teachers within the region. Collectively these Alliances are expected to have a national impact.

"EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement-Focused EPSCoR Collaborations Program","The Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) is designed to fulfill the mandate of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to promote scientific progress nationwide. EPSCoR eligibility status is yearly updated and reported in the EPSCoR website (see EPSCoR eligibility).
Through this program, NSF establishes partnerships with government, higher education, and industry that are designed to affect sustainable improvements in a jurisdiction's research infrastructure, Research and Development (R&D) capacity, and hence, its R&D competitiveness.
The RII-FEC program (formerly known as “EPSCoR Track-2 program”) builds interjurisdictional collaborative teams of EPSCoR investigators in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) focus areas consistent with the current National Science Foundation Strategic Plan. Projects are investigator-driven and must include researchers from at least two EPSCoR eligible jurisdictions with complementary expertise and resources necessary to address challenges, which neither party could address as well or as rapidly independently.  RII-FEC projects have a comprehensive and integrated vision to drive discovery and build sustainable STEM capacity that exemplifies individual, institutional, geographic, and disciplinary diversity. The projects’ STEM research and education activities seek to broaden participation through the strategic inclusion and integration of all individuals, institutions, and sectors. Additionally, EPSCoR recognizes that the development of early-career faculty from backgrounds that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields is critical to sustaining and advancing research capacity. The integration and inclusion of Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), women’s colleges, Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), and two-year colleges is a critical component of this sustainable STEM capacity.",coop,"2025-12-16, 2025-12-16",,505263,nsf24573,Cleared,2024-05-16,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/epscor-research-infrastructure-improvement-focused-epscor/nsf24-573,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/epscor-research-infrastructure-improvement-focused-epscor/nsf24-573/solicitation
"Correctness for Scientific Computing Systems (CS2)","Correctness for Scientific Computing Systems (CS2) is a joint program of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE). The program addresses challenges that are both core to DOE’s mission and essential to NSF’s mission of ensuring broad scientific progress. The program’s overarching goal is to elevate correctness as a fundamental requirement for scientific computing tools and tool chains, spanning low-level libraries through complex multi-physics simulations and emerging scientific workflows.
At an elementary level, correctness of a system means that desired behavioral properties will be satisfied during the system’s execution. In the context of scientific computing, correctness can be understood, at both the level of software and hardware, as absence of faulty behaviors such as excessive numerical rounding, floating-point exceptions, data races deadlocks, memory faults, violations of specifications at interfaces of system modules, and so on. The CS2 program puts correctness on an equal footing with performance, the focus of current scientific computing research. This program envisions the necessity of proving correctness even in performant scientific computing systems. Such correctness proofs themselves might rely upon multiple factors, including correctness of static and runtime program analyses. Recognizing that many scientific computing applications are inherently statistical, use probabilistic or randomized algorithms, and/or deal with uncertain data, probabilistic notions of correctness may be needed. It is also critical to realize that correctness guarantees are provided with respect to some pre-defined system model. For many reasons, including misspecification, approximation, and defect, the state space allowed by real systems might depart from that model. When this happens, the ability to probe the system to isolate the discrepancy is a key challenge in many domains.
CS2 requires close and continuous collaboration between researchers in two complementary areas of expertise. One area is scientific computing, which, for this solicitation, is broadly construed to include: models and simulations of scientific theories; management and analysis of data from scientific simulations, observations, and experiments; libraries for numerical computation; and allied topics. The second area is formal reasoning and mechanized proving of properties of programs, which, for this solicitation, is broadly construed to include automatic/interactive/auto-active verification, runtime verification, type systems, abstract interpretation, programming languages, program analysis, program logic, compilers, concurrency, stochastic reasoning, static and dynamic testing, property-based testing, and allied topics.",other,"2025-08-12, 2025-08-12",,506296,nsf24571,Cleared,2024-05-09,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cs2-correctness-scientific-computing-systems/nsf24-571,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cs2-correctness-scientific-computing-systems/nsf24-571/solicitation

"Mathematical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence (MFAI)","Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are enabling extraordinary scientific breakthroughs in fields ranging from protein folding, natural language processing, drug synthesis, and recommender systems to the discovery of novel engineering materials and products. These achievements lie at the confluence of mathematics, statistics, engineering and computer science, yet a clear explanation of the remarkable power and also the limitations of such AI systems has eluded scientists from all disciplines. Critical foundational gaps remain that, if not properly addressed, will soon limit advances in machine learning, curbing progress in artificial intelligence. It appears increasingly unlikely that these critical gaps can be surmounted with increased computational power and experimentation alone. Deeper mathematical understanding is essential to ensuring that AI can be harnessed to meet the future needs of society and enable broad scientific discovery, while forestalling the unintended consequences of a disruptive technology.  
The National Science Foundation Directorates for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Engineering (ENG), and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) will jointly sponsor research collaborations consisting of mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, engineers, and social and behavioral scientists focused on the mathematical and theoretical foundations of AI. Research activities should focus on the most challenging mathematical and theoretical questions aimed at understanding the capabilities, limitations, and emerging properties of AI methods as well as the development of novel, and mathematically grounded, design and analysis principles for the current and next generation of AI approaches.
Specific research goals include: establishing a fundamental mathematical understanding of the factors determining the capabilities and limitations of current and emerging generations of AI systems, including, but not limited to, foundation models, generative models, deep learning, statistical learning, federated learning, and other evolving paradigms; the development of mathematically grounded design and analysis principles for the current and next generations of AI systems; rigorous approaches for characterizing and validating machine learning algorithms and their predictions; research enabling provably reliable, translational, general-purpose AI systems and algorithms; encouragement of new collaborations across this interdisciplinary research community and from diverse institutions.
The overall goal is to establish innovative and principled design and analysis approaches for AI technology using creative yet theoretically grounded mathematical and statistical frameworks, yielding explainable and interpretable models that can enable sustainable, socially responsible, and trustworthy AI.

The CI PAOS program supports the NSF Public Access Initiative by encouraging innovation across the CI ecosystem to address accessibility, discoverability, reliability, reproducibility, sustainability, and utility of data products in alignment with NSF and national goals for public access and open science [See: NSF Public Access Initiative, Office of Science and Technology Policy Memorandum on Ensuring Free, Immediate, and equitable Access to Federally funded Research, and Desirable Characteristics of Data Repositories for Federally Funded Research]. CI PAOS builds on previous investments including those through Dear Colleague Letters NSF19-069,NSF20-068, NSF 23-018, and the FAIROS Research Coordination Networks (RCN) program solicitation (NSF 22-553).  


NSF accepts proposals pursuant to this Program Description year-round. From time to time, NSF may also issue Dear Colleague Letters to encourage proposals on special thematic interests and opportunities related to this program. 

GUIDANCE TO POTENTIAL PROPOSERS 


A primary feature of successful CI PAOS projects is a robust, synergistic collaborative team comprising skills from across communities of science/engineering, research data science, and information science discipline(s) and expertise in leveraging connections between cyberinfrastructure researchers and providers and data specialists.  Leveraging international collaboration to build shared norms and address challenges related to developing and implementing PAOS policies and practices is encouraged.  Research and education in science and engineering benefit immensely from international cooperation. Proposals with an international component are also welcome [See: International Collaborations Opportunities at NSF]. Proposers must target one or more of the following themes/pathways:Competency Building, Capability Building, and/or Community Building.  


Competency Building 


Open science/engineering-driven collaboration. A socio-technical collaborative approach in addressing disciplinary, interdisciplinary, domestic, and international data lifecycle challenges is critical to informing and guiding the development of principles, requirements, and standards of a CI ecosystem that fosters pipelines to good data management and pathways to access. Proposals should clearly describe the goals, challenges, and rationale for the proposed data science and engineering project and include an explanation of the potential for transformative research and broader impacts on the open science ecosystem [See: U.S. NSF Broader Impacts]. Successful proposals will also clearly identify utilization science scenarios and use cases. 


Capability Building 


Exploratory and pilot activities. Proposals are welcomed that support early-stage exploratory efforts that may comprise analysis, community planning, and pilot-level activities that inform future development and deployment of appropriately useful capabilities. Proposals for full-scale technical research data science efforts leading to development/deployment of larger scale capabilities should be directed to other appropriate NSF programs. Successful proposals will also clearly identify leveraging of existing cyberinfrastructure, funded projects, and resources. 


Community Building 


Integrative and accelerative approaches. Proposals are particularly welcomed that address common needs or gaps across multiple research disciplines and communities of practice; leverage and accelerate the impact of existing CI investments in infrastructure, resources, and services in one or more disciplinary domains; facilitate coordination, advance alignment, and/or build community with the international CI PAOS community; aim to reduce barriers to broader adoption of CI-enabled research data and open science/engineering approaches; and/or integrateas appropriate different aspects and elements of CI to achieve ecosystems with generative science/engineering and multi-discipline impact. 


Requirements to contact NSF Cognizant Program Officers. CI PAOS activities are inherently focused on collaborative research between fields of data and computer and information science and engineering researchers and other domain researchers. Successful CI PAOS projects will typically involve co-funding from the relevant disciplinary research programs within NSF. Consequently, before submitting a proposal to CI PAOS, proposers must discuss their project with a cognizant CI PAOS Program Officer and with the relevant NSF disciplinary research program officer(s) to ensure that CI PAOS is the appropriate venue and that there is adequate disciplinary interest in the proposed effort. 


Proposals that have been declined by CI PAOS or any other NSF program may not be resubmitted to CI PAOS without substantial revision. Proposals that do not align with CI PAOS program objectives and guidance may be returned without review. ","standard, continuing, other",,1,506307,pd247414,Cleared,2024-04-08,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ci-paos-cyberinfrastructure-public-access-open-science/pd24-7414,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/policies/pappg
"IUSE/Professional Formation of Engineers: Revolutionizing Engineering Departments (IUSE/PFE: RED)","Revolutionizing Engineering Departments (hereinafter referred to as RED) is designed to build upon previous efforts in engineering education research. Specifically, previous and ongoing evaluations of the NSF Engineering Education and Centers Division program and its predecessors, as well as those related programs in the Directorate for STEM Education, have shown that prior investments have significantly improved the first year of engineering students’ experiences, incorporating engineering material, active learning approaches, design instruction, and a broad introduction to professional skills and a sense of professional practice – giving students an idea of what it means to become an engineer. Similarly, the senior year has seen notable change through capstone design experiences, which ask students to synthesize the technical knowledge, skills, and abilities they have gained with professional capacities, using reflective judgment to make decisions and communicate these effectively. However, this ideal of the senior year has not yet been fully realized, because many of the competencies required in capstone design, or required of professional engineers, are only partially introduced in the first year and not carried forward with significant emphasis through the sophomore and junior years.
The Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and STEM Education (EDU) are funding projects as part of the RED program, in alignment with the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) framework and Professional Formation of Engineers (PFE) initiative. These projects are designing revolutionary new approaches to engineering education, ranging from changing the canon of engineering to fundamentally altering the way courses are structured to creating new departmental structures and educational collaborations with industry. A common thread across these projects is a focus on organizational and cultural change within the departments, involving students, faculty, staff, and industry in rethinking what it means to provide an engineering program.
In order to continue to catalyze revolutionary approaches, while expanding the reach of those that have proved efficacious in particular contexts, the RED program supports four tracks: RED Planning (Track 1), RED Adaptation and Implementation (Track 2), RED Innovation (Track 3), and RED Innovation Partnerships (Track 4). Two- and four-year institutions are encouraged to submit to any track as appropriate for their goals and context.
RED Planning (Track 1) projects will support capacity-building activities at institutions of special interest to NSF’s mission, specifically two-year engineering-centered programs building transfer partnerships, two-year or four-year institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions, Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), and Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) seeking to level the number of degrees across of the full spectrum of diverse talent in engineering. Planning projects should provide the support for such institutions to explore the development of a RED Projects in Tracks 2, 3, & 4.
RED Adaptation and Implementation (Track 2) projects will adapt and implement evidence-based organizational change strategies and actions to the local context, which helps propagate this transformation of undergraduate engineering education.
RED Innovation (Track 3) projects will develop new, revolutionary approaches and change strategies that enable the transformation of undergraduate engineering education.
RED Innovation Partnerships (Track 4) projects will achieve the same goals as Track 3 projects across multiple institutions. Of particular interest to this track are projects partnering two-year institutions with other eligible institutions.
Projects in tracks 2, 3, & 4 will include consideration of the cultural, organizational, structural, and pedagogical changes needed to transform one or more departments to ones in which students are engaged, develop their technical and professional skills, and establish identities as professional engineers or technologists. The focus of projects in these tracks should be on the department’s disciplinary courses and program. RED project initiatives are expected to be institutionalized at the end of the funding period.
Proposals are especially encouraged that address areas of increased national interest including but not limited to advanced manufacturing, advanced wireless, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, microelectronics and semiconductors, net zero technologies, sustainability, systems engineering, and quantum engineering.","standard, continuing","2025-09-09, 2025-09-09",,505105,nsf24564,Cleared,2024-04-04,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/iusepfe-red-iuseprofessional-formation-engineers-revolutionizing/nsf24-564,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/iusepfe-red-iuseprofessional-formation-engineers-revolutionizing/nsf24-564/solicitation

"Global Centers (GC)","This solicitation describes an ambitious program to fund international, interdisciplinary collaborative research centers that will apply best practices of broadening participation and community engagement to develop use-inspired bioeconomy research to address one or more global challenges identified by the scientific community. Here, the ""used-inspired"" nature of the research refers to project outcomes leading to foreseeable benefits to society. This program will prioritize research collaborations that foster team science and community-engaged research, use knowledge-to-action frameworks whose rationale, conceptualization, and research directions are driven by the potential use of the results as illustrated by Pasteur’s Quadrant (see Stokes, Donald E. (1997), ""Pasteur's Quadrant - Basic Science and Technological Innovation,"" Brooking Institution Press, p.196. ISBN 9780815781776). Proposals should also indicate how research will be co-generated with communities and stakeholders identified in the proposal. The proposed research should maximize the benefits of international, interdisciplinary collaborations, and describe the roles and responsibilities of each national team in achieving the goals of the proposed Global Center. Global Centers projects involving partnership between the U.S. and two or more partner countries are strongly encouraged. Global challenges must be addressed through international collaboration and researchers are encouraged to develop international teams to address research questions that can only be addressed through multilateral efforts.
The topic for the 2024 competition of the Global Centers program is Addressing Global Challenges through the Bioeconomy and may include research from any combination of research disciplines supported by NSF. The Bioeconomy is the share of the economy based on products, services, and processes derived from living systems. Research investments to advance the bioeconomy serve to accelerate scientific discovery and to enable the harnessing, engineering, and rational modulation of biological systems to create goods and services that contribute to the agriculture, health, security, manufacturing, energy, and environmental sectors of the global economy; or that provide access to unique systems that help us understand the processes and issues that we can use biotechnology to solve. Bioeconomy is built on the foundation of biotechnology and biomanufacturing, and in addition to biological science and engineering includes contributions from fields such as chemistry, materials science, geosciences, mathematics, data sciences, humanities, and the social sciences.
The world is facing many serious challenges, including, but not limited to, adapting to or mitigating the effect of climate change, developing clean energy approaches, identifying and advancing sustainable food systems, addressing water insecurity, exploring solutions to emerging infectious diseases, creating resource efficiency, sustaining biodiversity, addressing inequalities in access to biotechnologies, and developing a circular bioeconomy. For example, bio-based materials offer heightened biodegradability and biosafety as compared to reusable plastic materials that shed microplastics during use and washing and affect water security and human health.
This Global Centers solicitation in Bioeconomy offers a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary teams of scientists, educators, and practitioners to use knowledge of the bioeconomy to co-develop and execute a research plan for an international center that will address a global challenge facing humanity. The Global Centers program is meant to support multidisciplinary research that can only be achieved through international partnerships uniting complementary areas of expertise, and/or facilitating access to unique expertise or resources of the participating countries. The proposal should explain how the center will maximize the benefits of international collaborations and describe the unique contributions and the roles and responsibilities of each national team in achieving the goals of the proposed Global Center. Successful proposals will describe how the center will tackle a global challenge that can only be addressed through the diversity of knowledge, skills, and resources united in this center.
Addressing global challenges requires international engagement and must go beyond production of data to demonstrate how co-generation and co-production of research with stakeholder groups can maximize the chances of research outcomes being taken up by target groups and applied to address the global challenge. Because change requires human involvement, this process, described as the Knowledge to Action framework explicitly recognizes the need to involve appropriate scientific experts and practitioners who study and work with humans in implementing the human action aspect of the framework. Examples of human action include (but are not limited to) studies in human and societal behavior, in policy, economics, psychology, anthropology, or education. Proposals are expected to describe a center that fully integrates human action elements with the knowledge generation portions of the center to produce a holistic, multi-disciplinary center that is greater than the sum of its parts. The center should offer a plan of research in which disciplines are integrated and complement and support each other to produce world class research, train the next generation of workforce, and use best practices to ensure that participant communities and stakeholder groups are involved in all stages of the research process so that outcomes are aligned with their needs and readily adoptable.
Within the general theme of Bioeconomy, proposals submitted in the framework of this call must be centered on either or both of the two subtopics: Subtopic 1: Leveraging Biodiversity Across the Tree of Life to Power the Bioeconomy; and Subtopic 2: Biofoundries, using the Design-Build-Test-Learn process in biology. All proposals must integrate both of the two crosscutting themes into the proposed work: Crosscutting Theme A: Public engagement and co-generation of research activities to strengthen the global science and technology enterprise; and Crosscutting Theme B: Workforce Development and Education.  See Section II, Program Description for details.","standard, continuing",,,506146,nsf24556,Cleared,2024-03-11,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/gc-global-centers/nsf24-556,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/gc-global-centers/nsf24-556/solicitation
"Confronting Hazards, Impacts and Risks for a Resilient Planet (CHIRRP)","The Confronting Hazards, Impacts and Risks for a Resilient Planet Program (CHIRRP) invites projects focusing on innovative and transformative research that advances Earth system hazard knowledge and risk mitigation in partnership with affected communities. Hazards compounded by changing climates, rising populations, expanding demands for resources, aging infrastructure, and increasing reliance on technology are putting our economy, well-being, and national security at risk. Researchers, academics, and community leaders will work together to develop community-driven research questions and actionable, science-based solutions that increase community resilience now and in the future. CHIRRP projects are expected to advance understanding, forecasting and/or prediction of future Earth system hazards and risks, engage communities in development of research questions and approaches, and produce actionable, science-based solution pathways for adaptation methodologies, products, and services. CHIRRP projects may evaluate a single or system of cascading hazards, impacts, and risks at a local, regional, or global scale through the lens of transformative earth system science research. Competitive projects will engage community partners at all stages of a project from development to implementation.
CHIRRP currently supports planning, conference, RCNs, EAGER, and RAISE proposals that support development of community partnerships, provide training for effective community engagement, catalyze ideas, and/or support the initial conceptualization, planning and collaboration activities aimed at formulating new and sound plans for future large-scale projects.
CHIRRP Elements  CHIRRP projects will demonstrate convergence of three essential elements: (1) Equitable Community Partnerships; (2) an Earth System Science approach to advance knowledge of hazards, impacts, and risks and (3) Actionable Solutions that increase resilience. The initiative seeks solutions to existing as well as next-generation Earth system hazards1.
Build Equitable Community Partnerships: CHIRRP projects will serve a community and equitably co-produce project research questions and solutions. CHIRRP teams will bring together community members with direct knowledge of hazard impacts and community priorities and researchers with expertise in the natural and human dimensions of the Earth system. Partners may include, but are not limited to, local governments, Tribal Nations, civil society organizations, youth groups, and non-government organizations (NGOs). Robust partnerships are responsive to community priorities, may involve a social science component, and lead to actionable solutions that increase community resilience.
Advance Earth System Science: Generating practical and foundational knowledge on many of the nation's most urgent challenges requires a systems approach to understand the highly interdependent and complex natural and human components of the Earth system. CHIRRP projects will innovate and advance Earth System Science approaches that explore dynamic interactions and couplings among natural and social processes that affect Earths capacity to sustain the well-being of communities, infrastructure, and national security. Evaluate Actionable Science-Based Solutions: CHIRRP deliverables include co-produced innovative, science-based actionable solution pathways that mitigate future hazards, impacts, and risks. Multiple solutions may exist, and new solutions may emerge in the future. CHIRRP projects will inform pathways to resilience through evaluation of different solutions informed by the advancement of earth systems knowledge delivered from the project. An understanding of risk, vulnerability and resilience necessarily entails an understanding of relevant social dynamics including methods and analysis to identify how the impacts of hazards may disproportionately affect specific segments of a community or region. Solutions should be responsive to community priorities, including objectives such as reducing Earth system hazard related risk, increasing resilience, and advancing equity. 1National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2022.

"Hispanic-Serving Institutions: Enriching Learning, Programs, and Student Experiences (HSI:ELPSE)","Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) are an important component of the nation’s higher education ecosystem and play a critical role in realizing the National Science Board’s vision for a more diverse and capable science and engineering workforce1,2. Aligned with this vision and the NSF Strategic Plan3, the goals of the NSF HSI Program are to: 



Enhance the quality of undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at HSIs. 






Increase the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students pursuing associate’s or baccalaureate degrees in STEM at HSIs. 



Meeting these goals requires institutions to understand and embrace their students’ strengths, challenges, and lived experiences.  While this can happen in many ways and across many parts of an institution, the Hispanic Serving Institutions: Enriching Learning, Programs, and Student Experiences (HSI:ELPSE) solicitation is specifically focused on studying and improving the student experience in the following settings:   




STEM courses, particularly for students pursuing STEM degrees;  








Certificate, minor, and/or degree programs;  


Academic departments or divisions; and  


Schools and colleges that represent a part of the entire institution (e.g., a School of Engineering or a College of Natural Sciences).   




Institutions are encouraged to consider how their mission and designation as an HSI could reimagine and/or strengthen courses, degree programs, departments, or divisions. The HSI:ELPSE solicitation welcomes projects that look to implement, test and refine promising practices and/or conduct research related to broadening participation or improving recruitment, retention, graduation and other positive outcomes for undergraduates in STEM. 



The HSI:ELPSE solicitation supports projects that are purposefully designed to meet students where they are, accounting for both their assets and the challenges they may face. Identities and experiences are not determined solely by membership in a single monolithic population of students (e.g., Hispanic, first-generation, commuter, etc.). Consequently, institutions are expected to use institutional data to identify equity gaps, identify areas of need, and unpack the factors that shape students’ individual realities and shared experiences.  Perspectives gained from these data should be central to the design of the project.  


 This solicitation includes the following tracks: 





Implementation and Evaluation Projects (IEP): Levels 1 and 2  


Educational Instrumentation (EI) 




Please see below for specific information about each track. Generally, proposals to the IEP track will center on one or more of the following: courses; curricular improvements; pedagogy; support structures inside and outside of the classroom; degree programs; and student pathways. 


The HSI:ELPSE solicitation will also consider proposals designed to increase access to computing resources and/or laboratory instrumentation needed to provide high-quality undergraduate STEM education at the following types of institutions: (1) HSIs in EPSCoR jurisdictions; and (2) HSI Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) in all other (non-EPSCoR) jurisdictions. Please see the discussion of the Educational Instrumentation Track below for specific details.

"Developmental Sciences (DS)","Developmental Sciences supports basic research that increases our understanding of perceptual, cognitive, linguistic, social, cultural, and biological processes related to human development across the lifespan. Research supported by this program will add to our knowledge of the underlying developmental processes that support social, cognitive, and behavioral functioning, thereby illuminating ways for individuals to live productive lives as members of society.
The Developmental Sciences program supports research that addresses developmental processes within the domains of perceptual, cognitive, social, emotional, language, and motor development across the lifespan by working with any appropriate populations for the topics of interest including infants, children, adolescents, adults (including aging populations), and non-human animals. The program also supports research investigating factors that affect developmental change, including family, peers, school, community, culture, media, physical, genetic, and epigenetic influences. The program funds research that incorporates multidisciplinary, multi-method, and/or longitudinal approaches; develops new methods, models, and theories for studying development; and integrates different processes (e.g., memory, emotion, perception, cognition), levels of analysis (e.g., behavioral, social, neural) and time scales. The program funds basic research that advances our understanding of developmental processes and mechanisms; the program does not fund clinical trials and research focused primarily on health outcomes.
The budgets and durations of supported projects vary widely and are greatly influenced by the nature of the project. Investigators should focus on innovative, potentially transformative research plans and then develop a budget to support those activities, rather than starting with a budget number and working up to that value.
While there are no specific rules about budget limitations, a typical project funded through the Developmental Sciences program is approximately three years in duration with a total cost budget, including both direct and indirect costs, between $100,000 and $200,000 per year. Interested proposers are urged to explore the NSF awards database for the Developmental Sciences program to review examples of awards that have been made. Proposals that contain budgets significantly beyond this range may be returned without review.
The Developmental Sciences program also considers proposals for workshops and small conferences on a case-by-case basis. These typically have total cost budgets, including direct and indirect costs, of approximately $35,000. Conference proposals may only be submitted following an invitation from the Program Directors.
In addition to consulting the NSF awards database, it is often useful for interested proposers to submit (via email) a summary of no more than one page so that a program director can advise the investigator on the fit of the project for DS before the preparation of a full proposal. New investigators are encouraged to solicit assistance in the preparation of their project proposals via consultation with senior researchers in their area, pre-submission review by colleagues, and attendance at symposia and events at professional conferences geared towards educating investigators seeking federal funding.
The Developmental Sciences Program is always interested in identifying new reviewers. Potential reviewers should have a Ph.D. in psychology or a related field and have a demonstrated area of expertise relevant to developmental science. Individuals interested in reviewing for the program should complete an expression of interest form.

"Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Core Programs (MCB)","MCB supports research that promises to uncover the fundamental properties of living systems across atomic, molecular, subcellular, and cellular scales. The program gives high priority to projects that advance mechanistic understanding of the structure, function, and evolution of molecular, subcellular, and cellular systems, especially research that aims at quantitative and predictive knowledge of complex behavior and emergent properties. MCB encourages research exploring new concepts in molecular and cellular biology, while incorporating insights and approaches from other scientific disciplines, such as chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics, and physics, to illuminate principles that govern life at the molecular and cellular level. MCB also encourages research that exploits experimental and theoretical approaches and utilizes a diverse spectrum of model and non-model animals, plants, and microbes across the tree of life. Proposals that pursue potentially transformative ideas are welcome, even if these entail higher risk.
This solicitation calls for proposals in research areas supported by the four MCB core clusters, including: (i) structure, dynamics, and function of biomolecules and supramolecular assemblies, especially under physiological conditions (Molecular Biophysics); (ii) organization, processing, expression, regulation, and evolution of genetic and epigenetic information (Genetic Mechanisms); (iii) cellular structure, properties, and function across broad spatiotemporal scales (Cellular Dynamics and Function); and (iv) systems and/or synthetic biology to study complex interactions through modeling or manipulation or design of living systems at the molecular-to-cellular scale (Systems and Synthetic Biology). All MCB clusters prioritize projects that integrate across scales, investigate molecular and cellular evolution, synergize experimental research with computational or mathematical modeling, and/or develop innovative, broadly applicable methods and technologies. Projects that bridge the intellectual edges between MCB clusters are welcome. Projects that integrate molecular and cellular biosciences with other subdisciplines of biology are also welcome through the new Integrative Research in Biology (IntBIO) track.
All programs in the Directorate for Biological Sciences strive to achieve key goals laid out in the NSF Strategic Plan. Among these goals are: (i) to empower Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) talent to fully participate in science and engineering; (ii) to enable creation of new knowledge by advancing the frontiers of research and enhancing research capability; and (iii) to benefit society through translation of knowledge into solutions. In line with these goals, MCB welcomes the submission of proposals to this funding opportunity that include the participation of the full spectrum of diverse talent in STEM, e.g., as PI, co-PI, senior personnel, postdoctoral scholars, graduate or undergraduate students or trainees.  This includes historically under-represented or underserved populations, diverse institutions including Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), and two-year colleges, as well as major research institutions. Proposals from EPSCoR jurisdictions are especially encouraged. MCB has a new track in this solicitation, EXPAND MCB in EPSCoR, that welcomes proposals that build capacity through collaborations led by organizations in EPSCoR jurisdictions.
Also aligned with the NSF Strategic Plan, MCB encourages submission of proposals in support of discovery-based explorations, as well as use-inspired, solutions-focused research, including proposals that address priority areas associated with building a resilient planet and biotechnology and the bioeconomy. Some examples of topics that address priority areas associated with building a resilient planet and biotechnology and the bioeconomy can be found in the life on a warming planet and bioeconomy metaprogram descriptions. The CHIPs Act of 2022 and the Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation for a Sustainable, Safe and Secure American Bioeconomy highlight the importance of these two areas with respect to safeguarding national security and promoting prosperity. MCB also strongly encourages proposals that leverage NSF resources to facilitate integration across the biological sciences, such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), data networks, synthesis centers, and institutes.
Regarding health-related challenges, NSF supports basic research in all areas of the biological sciences and recognizes that this foundational research is likely to impact many different areas, including human health. MCB celebrates all the biological science discoveries funded through MCB awards that have had major impacts on health, environment, energy, food production, and other applications.

"Civic Innovation Challenge (CIVIC)","The Civic Innovation Challenge (CIVIC) is a research and action competition that accelerates the transition to practice of foundational research and emerging technologies into communities through civic-engaged research. By addressing priorities at the local scale that are relevant across the US, CIVIC is laying the foundation for a broader and more fluid exchange of research and technology capabilities and civic priorities through joint partnerships involving civic partners and the research community. CIVIC funds projects that pilot state-of-the-art solutions to community challenges over 12 months, following a six-month planning phase, and have the potential for lasting impact in the partnering community as well as the potential to be scaled and implemented in other communities. Additionally, the foundation for CIVIC projects should be rooted in maturing and transitioning state-of-the-art research in disciplines, including but not limited to computer science, engineering, geosciences, biological sciences, and social sciences.
CIVIC is uniquely designed to enable transition to practice of innovations into communities, as follows: (1) CIVIC flips the community-university dynamic, by empowering communities and researchers to jointly identify civic priorities ripe for innovation and to address these priorities as equal partners; (2) CIVIC focuses on research-centered solutions that are ready for piloting in and with communities on a short timescale, where real-world outcomes can be evaluated within 12 months; (3) CIVIC requires a coalition of communities and civic partners and a multi-disciplinary set of researchers to co-create and execute pilot projects; and (4) CIVIC organizes and fosters nationwide “communities of practice” around high-need problem areas that allow for meaningful knowledge sharing and cross-site collaboration during both the pre-development and piloting stages.
For this solicitation, civic partnership and engagement activities, communities, and academic and civic partners must be based in the United States or its protectorates. For purposes of clarity, civic partners may include local, state, or tribal government officials; non-profit representatives; community organizers or advocates; community service providers; and/or others working to improve their communities.
CIVIC is organized as a two-stage competition with two tracks centered around the following topic areas:

Track A. Climate and Environmental Instability - Building Resilient Communities through Co-Design, Adaption, and Mitigation
Track B. Bridging the gap between essential resources and services & community needs.

In Stage 1, approximately 35-40 Planning Grant awards will be made – each with a budget of up to $75,000 for six months to undertake planning and team development activities. These include solidifying the team, maturing the project plans, and preparing a well-developed full proposal for submission to Stage 2. Only Stage 1 CIVIC recipients can submit to the CIVIC Stage 2 competition.
In Stage 2, approximately 20 Full Awards will be made. These will be selected from Stage 1 award recipients. For Stage 2, proposals will be considered with budgets up to $1,000,000 for up to 12 months. Proposals must describe how the PIs will execute and evaluate their research-centered pilot projects.
Throughout both stages, NSF award recipient (2223449) MetroLab Network (metrolabnetwork.org, nsfcivicinnovation.org) will foster “communities of practice” through in-person and virtual activities, aimed at enhancing the teams’ capacity-building, networking, impact, and ability to create methods and solutions transferable to other communities.

"GROWING CONVERGENCE RESEARCH (GCR)","Convergence research is a means for solving vexing research problems, in particular, complex problems focusing on societal needs or deep scientific challenges. It entails integrating knowledge, methods, and expertise from different disciplines and developing novel paradigms that catalyze scientific discovery and innovation.
GCR identifies Convergence Research as having two primary characteristics:

Research driven by a specific and compelling problem. Convergence research is generally inspired by the need to address a specific challenge or opportunity, whether it arises from deep scientific questions or pressing societal needs.
Deep integration across disciplines. As experts from different disciplines pursue common research challenges, their knowledge, theories, methods, data, research communities and languages become increasingly intermingled or integrated. New frameworks, paradigms or even disciplines can form sustained interactions across multiple communities.

A distinct characteristic of convergence research, in contrast to other forms of multidisciplinary research, is that from the inception, the convergence paradigm intentionally brings together intellectually diverse researchers and stakeholders to frame the research questions, adopt common frameworks for addressing them, and create and implement innovative scientific approaches for their solution. This includes, when appropriate, developing new integrated theories, methods, research tools, and ways of communicating across disciplines and sectors. Research teams practicing convergence aim to develop sustainable collaborations that may not only create solutions to the specific problem studied, but also develop novel ways of investigating related research questions and open new research vistas.
This GCR solicitation targets multidisciplinary teams who are embracing convergence research as a means of developing highly innovative solutions to complex research problems.   GCR proposals are expected to be bold and address scientific or technical challenges and bottlenecks which if resolved have the potential to transform scientific understanding and solve vexing problems. Successful GCR projects are anticipated to lead to paradigm shifting approaches within disciplines, establishment of new scientific communities, or development of transformative technologies that have the potential for broad scientific or societal impact.
The aim of GCR is to cultivate and grow the earliest foundations of convergent approaches for addressing a specific and compelling problem. As such, proposals submitted to this solicitation are expected to explore novel avenues not previously investigated that are at the forefront of advancing science through deep integration. Proposers must make a convincing case that the research to be conducted is within NSF’s purview, integrates across NSF directorate or division boundaries, and is currently not supported by other NSF programs or solicitations.
The proposers must outline a five-year research plan delineated in two phases, Phase I: years 1-2, and Phase II: years 3-5. The total budget for Phase I may not exceed $1,200,000, and the total for Phase II may not exceed $2,400,000. Successful proposals will be funded initially for two years. Each team’s progress will be evaluated at a reverse site visit near the end of year 2; this will involve preparing a progress report and making a team presentation to a panel of reviewers/site visitors. Only teams that show exceptional progress according to the merit review and solicitation specific criteria during the first two years and that articulate plans for furthering advancements at the forefront of convergence research will be eligible for additional funding for up to three years pending availability  of funds.

"Future Manufacturing (FM)","The goal of Future Manufacturing is to support fundamental research, education, and training of a future workforce to overcome scientific, technological, educational, economic, and social barriers in order to catalyze new manufacturing capabilities that do not exist today. Future Manufacturing seeks inventive approaches to invigorate the manufacturing ecosystem and seed nascent future industries that can only be imagined today. Future Manufacturing supports research and education that will enhance U.S. leadership in manufacturing by providing new capabilities for companies and entrepreneurs, by improving our health, quality of life, and national security, by expanding job opportunities to a diverse STEM workforce, and by reducing adverse impacts of manufacturing on the environment. At the same time, Future Manufacturing enables new manufacturing that will address urgent social challenges arising from climate change, global pandemics and health disparities, social and economic divides, infrastructure deficits of marginalized populations and communities, and environmental sustainability. Future Manufacturing will complement existing efforts, supported by NSF and other federal agencies, in advanced manufacturing, but the focus of this program is to enable new, potentially transformative, manufacturing capabilities rather than to improve current manufacturing. Proposals that are incremental improvements over existing advanced manufacturing technologies will not be competitive.
The 2022 National Strategy for Advanced Manufacturing (NSAM) shows how advances in U.S. manufacturing enable the economy to continuously grow as new technologies and innovations increase productivity, enable next-generation products, support our capability to address the climate crisis, and create new, high-quality, and higher-paying jobs. It highlights the need to enhance environmental sustainability and address climate change through objectives that include decarbonization of processes and sustainable manufacturing and recycling. The CHIPS and Science Act supports research and education in semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing and in other areas ranging from additive manufacturing to artificial intelligence. The recent Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation for a Sustainable, Safe, and Secure American Bioeconomy aims to expand domestic biomanufacturing capacity for products spanning the health, energy, agriculture, and industrial sectors.
Manufacturing in the future will rely on computation to ensure the reliable translation of product designs to manufacturing plans; process controls to assure those plans produce products that meet specifications; new materials, chemicals, devices, processes, machines, and design and work methods; systems that encompass people, processes, equipment, materials, and information within a production environment; and new social structures and business practices. Fundamental research to overcome significant barriers will be required in quantum and semiconductor devices and integrated systems, robotics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, sustainable chemistry and production, materials science, education and public policy, and workforce development.
Three thrust areas have been identified for support under this solicitation:
Future Cyber Manufacturing Research,
Future Eco Manufacturing Research, and
Future Biomanufacturing Research.
This solicitation seeks proposals to perform fundamental research to enable new manufacturing capabilities in one or more of these thrust areas.
This solicitation will support the following two award tracks:
Future Manufacturing Research Grants (FMRG) - up to $3,000,000 for up to four years; and
Future Manufacturing Seed Grants (FMSG) - up to $500,000 for up to two years.
Proposals should take a convergence approach that involves cross-disciplinary partnerships among engineers, scientists, mathematicians, social and behavioral scientists, STEM education researchers, and experts in arts and humanities. Team sizes should be commensurate with the scope of the plans for science, technology, innovation, and education and workforce development.  
Proposals that include significant participation from minority-serving institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions, community colleges, institutions from EPSCoR states, and/or incorporate expertise in improving diversity and inclusion are especially encouraged.
The goal of this solicitation is to enable new manufacturing that represents a significant change from current practice. Therefore, proposers responding to this solicitation must include within the Project Description a section titled Enabling Future Manufacturing. Please see ""Proposal Preparation Instructions"" for additional details.
Realization of the benefits of the fundamental research supported under this solicitation will require the simultaneous education of a skilled technical workforce that can transition new discoveries into U.S. manufacturing companies. The National Science Board emphasizes this perspective in its report, ""THE SKILLED TECHNICAL WORKFORCE: Crafting America's Science and Engineering Enterprise."" Therefore, proposers responding to this solicitation must include a plan to equip students and upskill the workforce to enable Future Manufacturing. Please see ""Proposal Preparation Instructions"" for additional details.
The results of Future Manufacturing could change how workers interact with technology. Investigators may choose to address challenges in this area by including an optional component of research which focuses on future workers and their interactions with the new technology. Please see ""Proposal Preparation Instructions"" for specifics.
FURTHER INFORMATION: Informational webinars will be held on February 2, 2024 from 1:00-2:00 PM EST and February 28, 2025 from 1:00-2:00 PM to discuss the Future Manufacturing program and answer questions about this solicitation. Details about how to join a webinar will be posted at https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/future-manufacturing-fm.

"Enabling Access to the Semiconductor Chip Ecosystem for Design, Fabrication, and Training (Chip Design Hub)","Integrated micro/nano-electronic circuits (ICs) are a foundational technology that enable advancements in artificial intelligence, 5G/6G communication, security, scientific computing, quantum computing, and more. The economic competitiveness, technological leadership, and national security of the United States depend on a future workforce at the forefront of IC design and fabrication, spanning IC researchers, IC designers, and IC fabrication engineers and technicians. Since IC design and fabrication must deal with staggering complexities to meet system functionality, performance, and energy objectives, offering students at all levels with hands-on experiences designing and fabricating IC chips is imperative.
The needs of research and education communities in this domain have been widely recognized by a range of reports, including those derived from NSF-sponsored workshops. Prospective PIs for this solicitation are encouraged to read the following reports:

NSF Workshop on Micro/Nano Circuits and Systems Design and Design Automation: Challenges and Opportunities (https://nsfedaworkshop.nd.edu/assets/432289/nsf20_eda_workshop_report.pdf)
NSF Integrated Circuit Research, Education and Workforce Development Workshop (https://nsf-ic-education.com/NSF_IC_Workshop_Final_Report.pdf)
NSF Workshop on CMOS+X Technologies (https://e3s-center.berkeley.edu/nsf-workshop-cmosx/cmos-x-report/)

In response to the urgent need for chip fabrication support in the academic community, NSF has invested in several new funding opportunities (e.g., Supplements for Access to Semiconductor Fabrication (ASF, https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/supplements-access-semiconductor-fabrication-asf), Partnership for Prototyping of CMOS+X Systems (CMOS+X, https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22076/nsf22076.jsp). Advanced Chip Engineering Design and Fabrication (ACED Fab, https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/advanced-chip-engineering-design-fabrication-aced). While these investments support chip fabrication by academic researchers, they do not address end-to-end semiconductor chip design. This solicitation fills that gap. 
The aim of this solicitation is (i) to dramatically lower the barriers to accessing state-of-the-art electronic design automation (EDA) tools, process design kits (PDKs), and design intellectual property (IP) cores for students and academic researchers, and (ii) to enable students at various levels to design IC chips. A key goal is to broaden participation in IC chip design beyond the small number of institutions currently engaged in these activities.
This solicitation seeks proposals to establish and manage a community infrastructure that supports the entire IC chip design process beginning from behavior/structural description at the Register Transfer Level (RTL) or above to GDSII fabrication mask file generation. The infrastructure should provide licensing, access, and maintenance of (i) commercial and/or open-source EDA tools necessary for the end-to-end IC chip design and verification process, and (ii) design PDK/IPs at various CMOS technology nodes (potentially including emerging technologies), as well as support for multi-project-chip (MPC) integration. Further, proposals should include efforts to develop, curate, and host educational/tutorial materials on the entire IC chip design flow to help train the next generation of IC designers and researchers.
PIs interested in submitting a proposal to this program are strongly encouraged to discuss their plans with cognizant Program Officers.

"Centers for Innovation and Community Engagement in Solid Earth Geohazards","The Centers for Innovation and Community Engagement in Solid Earth Geohazards program supports university-based centers to advance research on the fundamental solid Earth processes that underpin natural hazards. Centers will catalyze, coordinate, and produce transformative research, lead innovation, and enable convergent approaches for systems-level insights that require the collective efforts of a large group of individuals.
Centers focus on addressing major, fundamental science challenges for understanding solid Earth geohazards, primarily those related to faulting, volcanoes, mass movements, and other dynamic processes.  In particular, the Centers will advance understanding in one or more of the priorities outlined in the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine decadal survey report The Earth in Time, including; What is an earthquake? What drives volcanism? What are the causes and consequences of topographic change? and How can Earth science research reduce the risk and toll of geohazards?
Centers will also foster different dimensions of community engagement to meaningfully improve the national welfare. Flagship community engagement activities will take bold and creative action to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the geoscience workforce and expand the impact of fundamental research in solid Earth geohazards to inform and prepare a broader community. Centers will establish partnerships to enable public outreach, hazard mitigation and other community engagement activities.
In 2024, the Program competition will support Center Operation awards intended to support the operation of a fully developed center addressing topics focusing on the fundamental processes that create solid Earth geohazards, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, and/or other solid Earth or tectonic processes. ",coop,,,505938,nsf24515,Cleared,2023-12-12,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/centers-innovation-community-engagement-solid-earth/nsf24-515,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/centers-innovation-community-engagement-solid-earth/nsf24-515/solicitation

"Cognitive Neuroscience (CogNeuro)","The Cognitive Neuroscience (CogNeuro) program seeks to fund proposals that can advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying human cognition and behavior. Funded proposals typically relate precise and rich quantifications of physiological responses and behavior in ways that advance theory (Intellectual Merit). Funded proposal also typically strengthen the field through, for example, outreach, mentoring the next generation of diverse cognitive neuroscientists, and/or increasing awareness and utilization of the research the field produces (Broader Impacts).
 
Intellectual Merit
In general, successful proposals provide a theoretical motivation and consist of a series of experiments/analyses that test the differential predictions of that theory; they go beyond quantifying physiology during certain tasks and behaviors. Research topics considered for funding include but are not limited to: perception, recognition, categorization, implicit and explicit memory, working memory, attention, language, decision-making, and social reasoning. Commensurate with the inherently multidisciplinary nature of the field and the limitations of any single technique, a wide variety of physiological methods are considered, including but not limited to: neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI, EEG, MEG), non-invasive stimulation (e.g. TMS, tDCS), lesion analysis, intracranial recording, optogenetics, genetics, optical imaging, computational modeling, and pharmacological interventions in both human and non-human primates and other animal models. The program is particularly interested in proposals that achieve or enable convergence across multiple techniques.
Critically, proposals will be returned without review if they are focused on: 1) either behavior or physiology and lack a specific link between them, 2) understanding clinical populations, 3) non-human animals without a clear benefit to our understanding of humans.
 
Broader Impacts
In general, successful proposals make impacts beyond traditional academic routes, such as publishing research or teaching undergraduate courses. Strong broader impacts can be quite varied but will typically involve specific efforts strengthening the field and/or increasing its visibility that leverage the characteristics of the institution, department, and/or researcher. Consider the following non-exhaustive examples: 1) STEM education and outreach, particularly in underserved communities, 2) directly involving undergraduates and high-school students in research, 3) making tools and applications for the general public, 4) science journalism or advocacy. These efforts can, but need not, directly relate to the proposed research. It is also encouraged to include budget for these efforts if warranted.
 
Mentoring Plans
Strong mentoring plans generally go beyond inclusion in standard lab activities and incorporate specific ideas for forwarding the careers of young scientists and trainees that leverage the setting and content of the proposed research.
 
General Directions
Prior to the development of a full proposal, investigators are strongly encouraged to submit a one-page summary of the proposed research to a program director to evaluate its appropriateness for the CogNeuro program. Please contact the director early enough to allow for revisions and incorporation what may be extensive feedback. The summary should include an overview of your research and statements of intellectual merit and broader impacts, the two NSF review criteria.
See the Merit Review Fact Sheet for more important facts about the NSF merit review process. Please read the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) carefully, as it will be strictly adhered to even if other directives or communications appear to contradict it.
Currently, the average standard/CAREER award size is $175,000-$225,000 per year for 3-5 years. Awards in excess of $1.0 million are exceptionally rare and almost always multidisciplinary. Please be judicious in your requests, understanding the realities of the limited funding available for all proposals. See the Listing of Active Cognitive Neuroscience Awards for additional award information.
Declined proposals are ineligible for resubmission until a minimum of one year has passed since the due date of their initial submission, unless specifically allowed by the PO in the feedback received during the decline process. This moratorium allows investigators the time required to digest the results of the merit review and revise their proposal accordingly. A proposal that has not been substantially revised will be returned without review as per the PAPPG.
PIs are strongly encouraged to submit the Single Copy Document titled “List of Suggested Reviewers” with their full proposal. Sharing of data and other materials is an expectation for funded research. Please consult the NSF Dear Colleague Letter: Effective Practices for Data for more details.

"Research Infrastructure in the Social and Behavioral Sciences (RISBS)","The Research Infrastructure in the Social and Behavioral Sciences Program (RISBS) supports projects that create computational tools and data to facilitate basic research in the social and behavioral sciences that can lead to improved health, prosperity and security.
Projects should be aimed at creating computational tools and data to enable research by social scientists. Examples include, but are not limited to, data collection or assembly efforts that result in new resources for a community of researchers or software platforms that facilitate data collection efforts by others. RISBS does not support research by PIs except in service of creation of the infrastructure. Innovation is especially encouraged.  
RISBS directly supports three key longitudinal surveys and panel studies that provide researchers with data on how American society functions and changes over time (and in 2010 were recognized as among the 60 most significant ""discoveries or advances that... have had a large impact or influence on every American’s life... call[ed] the ‘Sensational 60’, in honor of NSF’s 60th anniversary”):

The American National Election Study, which started in 1948 and has been funded by NSF since 1977, provides “gold standard” data on voting, public opinion, and political participation in U.S. national elections.
The General Social Survey, a nationally representative interview survey of the U.S. adult population, collects data on a wide range of topics and has been funded by NSF since its inception in 1972.
The Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample of U.S. families begun in 1968 (with NSF taking over most of its funding in 1980) collects data on a wide array of economic, social and health factors.

The RISBS program administers separate solicitations for the American National Election Study (ANES), the General Social Survey (GSS) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). These solicitations have specific requirements and submission deadlines. Other infrastructure proposals may be submitted directly to the RISBS program at any time or transferred from other SBE programs following the respective program’s submission guidelines. RISBS also collaborates with other programs in the social and behavioral sciences through a co-funding process to support projects that create especially valuable tools for researchers in those fields or are furthering innovations in research infrastructure.
Prospective PIs may also be interested in the Human Networks and Data Science Program — Infrastructure (HNDS-I), which supports proposals addressing the development of data resources and relevant analytic techniques that support research in the social, behavioral and economic sciences. Prospective PIs are strongly encouraged to contact the RISBS program officers and/or program officers from other SBE programs that may be applicable to the proposal before submitting to RISBS and to refer to the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) policies on duplicate or substantially similar proposals.","standard, continuing",,1,506221,pd23277Y,Cleared,2023-09-27,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/risbs-research-infrastructure-social-behavioral-sciences/pd23-277y,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/policies/pappg

"Enabling Partnerships to Increase Innovation Capacity (EPIIC)","The purpose of this solicitation is to broaden participation in innovation ecosystems that advance key technologies (e.g., advanced manufacturing, advanced wireless, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, quantum information science, semiconductors, novel materials, and microelectronics) by supporting capacity-building efforts at institutions of higher education (IHEs) interested in growing external partnerships. Creation of this program is motivated by the commitment of the National Science Foundation (NSF), including the newly established NSF Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), to accelerate scientific and technological innovation nationwide and empower all Americans to participate in the U.S. research and innovation enterprise. Establishing more inclusive innovation ecosystems will require broad networks of partners working together in support of use-inspired research; the translation of such research to practice or commercial application; and the development of a skilled workforce. The NSF Regional Innovation Engines (NSF Engines) program, housed within the TIP Directorate, seeks to grow inclusive innovation ecosystems around the country. Growing such ecosystems will only be successful if all interested IHEs within a region are able to participate and contribute their unique set of skills and expertise. However, NSF appreciates many Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), and two-year institutions lack the infrastructure and resources needed to grow external partnerships and effectively contribute to innovation ecosystems, and thus are currently unable to effectively engage with the NSF Engines program.
This solicitation aims to provide MSIs, PUIs, and two-year institutions with limited or no research capacity (see Section IV for details) with the support necessary to become equitable partners with teams competing under the current and subsequent NSF Engines program funding opportunities. Importantly, participation in this solicitation is not predicated on an existing partnership with organizations submitting an NSF Engines proposal. Rather, it is expected that the capacity-building efforts funded under this solicitation will provide significant innovation partnership opportunities irrespective of future participation in an NSF Engine.

"Research in the Formation of Engineers (RFE)","The NSF Engineering Directorate (ENG) has launched a multi-year initiative, the Professional Formation of Engineers, to create and support an innovative and inclusive engineering profession for the 21st century. Professional Formation of Engineers (PFE) refers to the formal and informal processes and value systems by which people become engineers. It also includes the ethical responsibility of practicing engineers to sustain and grow the profession in order to improve quality of life for all peoples. The engineering profession must be responsive to national priorities, grand challenges, and dynamic workforce needs; it must be equally open and accessible to all.
Professional Formation of Engineers includes, but is not limited, to:

Introductions to the profession at any age;
Development of deep technical and professional skills, knowledge, and abilities in both formal and informal settings/domains;
Development of outlooks, perspectives, ways of thinking, knowing, and doing;
Development of identity as an engineer and its intersection with other identities; and
Acculturation to the profession, its standards, and norms.

The goal of the Research in the Formation of Engineers (RFE) program is to advance our understanding of professional formation. It seeks both to deepen our fundamental understanding of the underlying processes and mechanisms that support professional formation and to demonstrate how professional formation is or can be accomplished. Ultimately RFE aims to transform the engineer-formation system, and thus the impact of proposed projects on this system must be described. Principal Investigators (PIs) should provide a roadmap detailing how they envision the proposed research will eventually broadly impact practice within the engineer-formation system, even if these activities are not within the scope of the submitted proposal.
In order to accomplish its goals, RFE welcomes proposals in two categories: Research Projects, and Design and Development Projects. Research Projects address fundamental questions of professional formation, while Design and Development Projects provide new approaches to achieving professional formation. Additional details are provided below. Projects in both categories should address the iterative cycle in which research questions that advance understanding are informed by practice and the results of research are, in turn, translated into practice. In other words, proposals should explain how the research results will travel, translate, transfer, or scale. Successful projects identify specific target audiences, effective communication channels, and novel partnerships to ensure effective propagation and scaling. Proposal titles should begin with either “Research:” or “Design and Development:” as appropriate.
Research Projects
Research proposals are particularly welcome in the following areas:

Research that addresses lifelong learning by the engineering workforce.
Research on the impact of engineering education research. Proposals addressing this topic could investigate questions such as: How can we measure the impacts of engineering education research? What are effective strategies for scaling reforms? How can we translate knowledge from research to practice? What are the roles of technologies, networks and communities in achieving impact? RFE does not support efficacy, effectiveness, or scale-up studies for specific interventions.
Research that addresses culture change in engineering education. Included in this topic are investigations of normative cultures of engineering at any level in the engineering education ecosystem and how these cultures may disadvantage certain groups.
Research that addresses engineering formation at the two-year college level in both formal and informal settings.
Research that addresses engineering formation at the graduate education level in both formal and informal settings.
Research that investigates engineering in P-12 settings. Research in this area could include understanding of approaches to engineering in P-12, how to develop engineering ways of thinking, or the relationship between practices within the sciences and mathematics and engineering thinking.
Research on the transitions between education levels, e.g., from high school to two-year college, high school to four-year college/university, two-year college to four-year college/university, undergraduate to graduate school, education settings to the workforce or professoriate, etc.
Research that addresses the relationship between engineering and the public. Proposals addressing this topic could consider the social impact of engineering solutions, citizen engineering, education of an informed public, etc.
Research that develops or adapts novel methodologies and frameworks appropriate for studying the professional formation of engineers, and especially minoritized, marginalized, or underserved populations.
Research that addresses ways in which new technologies (such as artificial intelligence and machine learning) are changing engineering education.
Research to transform engineering education so that all students encounter environmental and social sustainability principles as an integrated part of their education and are equipped with the tools needed to incorporate these principles into their future research, careers, and innovations.

Proposals submitted to the Research Projects category should have clear research questions informed by an appropriate theoretical framework and a research design that includes sampling, data collection, and data analysis methods. This category will not support proposals that seek funding primarily to develop tools, curriculum, or laboratories, or that seek to implement classroom innovations that have already been shown to be effective in engineering. The program will evaluate the value of proposals by considering the impact and the cost. Research track projects that are small, exploratory, or speculative are especially encouraged. Larger Research track projects should have a correspondingly larger impact.
Design and Development Projects
RFE supports Design and Development projects (see https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf13126) that seek to develop and test new approaches in the following areas related to engineering education:

Graduate education.
Undergraduate education in new engineering technologies and environmental sustainability.
Transitions between education levels, for example high school to two-year college, high school to four-year college/university, two-year college to four-year college/university, undergraduate to graduate school, education settings to the workforce or professoriate, etc.
P-12, especially approaches to develop engineering thinking, or providing links between engineering, science, and mathematics.

Proposals in this category should propose the design and development of new approaches that are informed by existing literature and theory. There should be clear objectives and the evaluation plan should be designed to determine if those objectives have been met. Projects cannot be solely demonstration projects but must add to the engineering education literature to inform future work.",,,1,506225,pd241340,Cleared,2023-09-13,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/rfe-research-formation-engineers/pd24-1340,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/policies/pappg

"Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet)","The contemporary research landscape is a collaborative and international enterprise requiring high level coordination among multi-disciplinary, cross-cultural teams. As such, the Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations program (AccelNet) values cooperation over competition. Program goals are to 1) leverage prior NSF support for building research capacity towards activities that launch international research network of networks (NoN) that will lead to an accelerated advancement of an area of science after the award period and 2) recruit and foster a diverse and internationally competent US-based workforce trained in conducting and leading multi-team international collaboration. Any area funded by the National Science Foundation is eligible, particularly those addressing grand research challenges identified within research communities and/or by NSF.
Successful proposals will demonstrate that the proposed activities will: 1) accelerate scientific research at a rate that would not be possible without concerted international cooperation in research planning; 2) make NoN members more competitive for research awards following the period of award; 3) recruit and foster a US-based diverse and internationally competent workforce trained in conducting and leading multi-team international collaboration. Proposals must include detailed plans for collaborative networking activities that will result in a synergy of effort across the entire NoN.
The AccelNet Program has two tracks. The Design Track allows PIs to build on prior research by providing time and resources for building capacity across teams to launch a synergistic international NoN. The Implementation Track allows PIs to build on prior research or networking activities by providing time and resources to implement an international NoN. There are two phases to the Implementation Track. Phase 1 funding is for activities related exclusively to NoN activities and is open to all PIs, including but not limited to prior successful Design Track PIs. Phase 2 funding is for early concept research arising from Phase 1 activities and is only open to Phase 1 PIs who have identified a critical research gap during synergistic networking activities in the first 18-24 months of Phase 1 awards.","standard, continuing",,,505584,nsf23619,"Current but no longer receiving proposals",2023-08-25,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/accelnet-accelerating-research-through-international-network-network/nsf23-619,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/accelnet-accelerating-research-through-international-network-network/nsf23-619/solicitation

"Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering (DARE)","The Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering program is part of the Engineering Biology and Health cluster, which also includes: 1) the Biophotonics program; 2) the Biosensing program; 3) the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program; and 4) the Engineering of Biomedical Systems program.
The Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering program supports fundamental engineering research that will improve the quality of life of persons with disabilities through the development of new theories, methodologies, technologies, or devices. Disabilities could be developmental, cognitive, hearing, mobility, visual, selfcare, independent living, or other. Proposed projects must advance knowledge regarding a specific human disability or pathological motion or understanding of injury mechanisms.
Research may be supported that is directed toward the characterization, restoration, rehabilitation, and/or substitution of human functional ability or cognition, or to the interaction between persons with disabilities and their environment. Areas of particular interest are neuroengineering, rehabilitation robotics, brain-inspired assistive or rehabilitative systems, theoretical or computational methods, and novel models of functional recovery including the development and application of artificial physiological systems.
Emphasis is placed on significant advancement of fundamental engineering knowledge that facilitates transformative outcomes. The DARE Program encourages high-risk/high-reward proposals that surpass incremental technological improvements. The DARE Program also encourages participatory design and the inclusion of trainees with disabilities as part of the proposed research or broader impacts.
Innovative proposals outside of the above specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the PI contact the Program Director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.
NSF does not support clinical trials; however, feasibility studies involving human volunteers may be supported if appropriate to the project objectives. The development and application of artificial physiological systems that do not model functional recovery and instead improve fundamental understanding of physiological and pathophysiological processes would be appropriate for EBMS.
Furthermore, the DARE program does not support proposals having as their central theme commercialization of a product. Small businesses seeking early stage R&D funding for product development are encouraged to contact the NSF SBIR/STTR program in the America's Seed Fund within the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP).

"Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics","The Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program is part of the Chemical Process Systems cluster, which also includes: 1) the Catalysis program; 2) the Electrochemical Systems program; and 3) the Interfacial Engineering program.
The goal of the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program is to advance fundamental engineering research on the rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions, systems engineering, and molecular thermodynamics as they relate to the design and optimization of chemical reactors and the production of specialized materials that have important impacts on society. 
The program supports the development of advanced optimization and control algorithms for chemical processes, molecular and multi-scale modeling of complex chemical systems, fundamental studies on molecular thermodynamics, and the integration of these methods and concepts into the design of novel chemical products and manufacturing processes. This program supports sustainable chemical manufacturing research on the development of energy-efficient chemical processes and environmentally-friendly chemical products through concurrent chemical product/process design methods. Sustainability is also enhanced by research that promotes the electrification of the chemical process industries over current thermally-activated processes.
Proposals should focus on:

Chemical reaction engineering: This area encompasses the interaction of transport phenomena and kinetics in reactive systems and the use of this knowledge in the design of chemical reactors. Research areas include(1) development of novel reactor designs, such as catalytic and membrane reactors, micro-reactors, chemical vapor and atomic layer deposition systems, (2) studies of reactions in supercritical fluids, (3) novel reaction activation techniques such as atmospheric pressure plasmas (which may be submitted under the ECLIPSE meta-program) and microwave radiation, (4) design of multifunctional and intensified systems, such as chemical-factory/lab-on-a-chip concepts, (5) nanoparticle nucleation, growth, and surface functionalization, and (6) biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals. The program also supports new approaches that enable the design of modular chemical manufacturing systems such as distributed hydrogen and ammonia production processes.
Process design, optimization, and control: This area encompasses process systems science, including the development of process modeling, design, control and optimization theory and algorithms; process development proposals are not appropriate for this program. High-priority research topics include process intensification, modular process systems, smart manufacturing, large-scale carbon dioxide capture and conversion, computational tools (including those based on quantum computing methods) enabling advanced chemical manufacturing, real-time optimization and control of large-scale chemical systems with quantitative sustainability metrics, machine learning, and optimization of enterprise-wide processes involving planning, scheduling, and real-time control to create resilient supply chains.
Reactive polymer processing: Program scope in this area is limited to research that integrates synthesis and processing to engineer specific nanoscale structures and compositions to tune the macroscopic scale properties of polymers, such as their ability to biodegrade or to be recycled. The focus is on reactive processes that address these environmental concerns while producing tailor-made macromolecular materials.
Molecular thermodynamics: This area focuses on fundamental research that combines principles of classical thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and atomistic-scale simulations to improve chemical processing and to facilitate synthesis of novel functional materials such as catalysts, polymers, solvents, and colloids. Topics include fundamental studies on self- and directed-assembly of nanoscale-level patterned polymer films, machine-learning methods to predict structure-property relationships, large-ensemble molecular dynamics simulations, simulation of peptide self-assembly and protein interactions, and behavior of multiphase and reactive systems under nanoscale confinement. The ultimate goal of research supported by this program is to enable the development of more efficient chemical processes, improve environmental sustainability and water quality, and design functional materials with tailored properties.

Innovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.

"Cellular and Biochemical Engineering","Synopsis
The Cellular and Biochemical Engineering (CBE) program is part of the Engineering Biology and Health cluster, which also includes: 1) the Biophotonics program; 2) the Biosensing program; 3) the Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering program; and 4) the Engineering of Biomedical Systems program.
The Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program supports fundamental engineering research that advances understanding of cellular and biomolecular processes. CBE-funded research may lead to the development of enabling technology for advanced biomanufacturing of therapeutic cells, biochemicals, and biopharmaceuticals, and for other biotechnology industrie .
The program encourages highly innovative and potentially transformative engineering research leading to novel bioprocessing and biomanufacturing approaches. Fundamental to many CBE research projects is the understanding of how biomolecules, subcellular systems, cells, and cell populations interact, and how those interactions lead to changes in structure, function, and behavior. A quantitative treatment of problems related to biological processes is considered vital to successful research projects in the CBE program. 
Major areas of interest for the program include:

Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology for biomanufacturing,
The design of synthetic metabolic components and synthetic cells, 
Microbiome structure, function, maintenance, and design,
Protein and enzyme engineering, and
Design of integrated chemoenzymatic systems.

The CBE program also encourages proposals that effectively integrate knowledge and practices from different disciplines while incorporating ongoing research into educational activities.
All proposals should include a description on the potential impact of proposed research on an associated biomanufacturing process.
Proposals whose core innovation involves tissue engineering, organ culture, development of models of healthy or diseased physiology, or design and application of technologies focused on the diagnosis or treatment of disease should be submitted to the Engineering of Biomedical Systems program (CBET 5345). 



Innovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.

"Engineering of Biomedical Systems","The Engineering of Biomedical Systems program is part of the Engineering Biology and Health cluster, which also includes: 1) the Biophotonics program; 2) the Biosensing program; 3) the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program; and 4) the Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering program.
The goal of the Engineering of Biomedical Systems (EBMS) program is to provide opportunities for fundamental and transformative research projects that integrate engineering and life sciences to solve biomedical problems and serve humanity in the long term.  Projects are expected to use an engineering framework (for example, design or modeling) that supports increased understanding of physiological or pathophysiological processes. Projects must include objectives that advance both engineering and biomedical sciences.
Projects may include: methods, models, and enabling tools applied to understand or control living systems; fundamental improvements in deriving information from cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems; or new approaches to the design of systems that include both living and non-living components for eventual medical use in the long term.
The EBMS program supports fundamental and transformative research in the following areas of biomedical engineering:

Development of validated models (living or computational) of healthy and pathological tissues and organ systems that can support improved fundamental understanding of these systems or that could be applied in the future for development and testing of medical interventions;
Design and validation of systems that integrate living and non-living components for improved understanding of physiology that could be applied in the future for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of disease or injury;
Design and subsequent application of technologies and tools to investigate fundamental physiological and pathophysiological processes;
Advanced biomanufacturing of three-dimensional tissues and organs; and
Application of engineering tools and principles, including mathematical modeling, to quantitatively study the immune system in health and disease and to develop techniques for controlling and modulating a host’s immune response to challenges such as infectious diseases, cancer, implants, autoimmune disorders, wounds, etc.

The long-term impact of the projects can be related to effective disease diagnosis and/or treatment, or improved health care delivery. However, immediate goals should focus on improved fundamental understanding of cell and tissue function in normal or pathological conditions and advancing biomedical engineering.
Innovative proposals outside of these specific areas of biomedical engineering may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is strongly recommended that the PIs contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review. Related programs also fund biomedical engineering research, and PIs are encouraged to examine these to find the appropriate program for submission.
The EBMS program does not support proposals having as their central theme drug design and delivery, the development of biomedical devices that do not include a living biological component, or the development of animal models of disease. For consideration by the EBMS program, proposals that advance the design of tools or technologies should also apply those technologies to advance knowledge in biomedical science.  NSF does not support clinical trials; however, feasibility studies involving human volunteers may be supported if appropriate to the project objectives.
Projects with a central focus on design or optimization of a device, material, algorithm, or process alone without exploring new fundamental biomedical science are not appropriate for the EBMS program. Furthermore, although research on biomaterials, cellular biomechanics, manufacturing systems, or algorithm/device design may constitute a part of the proposed studies, such research can be more appropriately targeted to other NSF programs:

Projects that aim to improve protein engineering or cellular biomanufacturing - either manufacturing cells or cell-derived products - should consider the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering (CBE) program.
Projects that focus on the development and application of microphysiological systems that model functional recovery related to a specific human disability or injury mechanism should consider the Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering (DARE) program.
Biomaterials-focused projects should consider the Biomaterials (BMAT) program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR).
Cellular and tissue biomechanics projects should consider the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology (BMMB) program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI). 
Manufacturing systems proposals should consider the Advanced Manufacturing (AM) program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI). 
Innovative research on signal processing techniques or dynamic biosensing systems should consider the Communications, Circuits, and Sensing-Systems (CCSS) program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS).
Innovative research on novel devices based on the principles of electronics, optics and photonics, optoelectronics, magnetics, opto- and electromechanics, electromagnetics, and related physical phenomena, also including material-device interaction, should consider the Electronics, Photonics and Magnetic Devices (EPMD) Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS).

Catalysis,"The Catalysis program is part of the Chemical Process Systems cluster, which also includes: 1) the Electrochemical Systems program; 2) the Interfacial Engineering program; and 3) the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program.
The goals of the Catalysis program are to increase fundamental understanding in catalytic engineering science and to advance the development of catalysts and catalytic reactions that are beneficial to society. Research should focus on critical challenges and opportunities in both new and proven catalysis technologies. Areas of emphasis may include novel catalyst compositions, structures, operating environment, data science tools, theory, and modeling – preferably in various combinations as dictated by the specific reaction and related knowledge and technology gaps. Target applications include fuels, specialty and bulk chemicals, environmental catalysis, biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals, greenhouse gas mitigation, recycling of waste materials, generation of solar hydrogen, as well as efficient routes to energy utilization.
Heterogeneous catalysis represents the main thrust of the program. Proposals related to both gas-solid and liquid-solid heterogeneous catalysis are welcome, as are proposals that incorporate concepts from homogeneous catalysis. Recent research trends have highlighted the need for evaluation of catalyst performance and properties under working conditions, especially as supported by advanced in situ and in operando characterization methods. Catalyst synthesizability and stability present additional research opportunities given the harsh operating environments of many catalytic processes.    
Topic areas of particular interest include:

Energy-related catalysis, utilizing renewable or sustainable energy in lieu of thermal, fossil fuel-based technologies, especially applications in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and catalytic conversion of biomass-derived chemicals, and also including fuel cell catalysis.
Catalysis aimed at closing the carbon cycle (especially conversion of carbon dioxide, methane, and natural gas to fuels and chemical intermediates).
Heterogeneous catalytic alternatives to traditionally non-catalytic or homogeneous reaction processes, as well as new catalyst designs for established catalytic processes.  
Environmental catalysis focused on mitigating both air and water pollutants, and supporting energy-efficient upcycling of waste materials to higher-value products.
Catalytic remediation of feedstocks, process streams, products, or effluents.
Commercially scalable methods of catalyst synthesis, including durable, poison-resistant, and easily regenerable catalyst formulations and designs.
New catalytic materials and architectures (especially those substituting earth-abundant materials for precious and noble metal catalysts).
Basic understanding of catalytic materials, reaction pathways, kinetics, and surface reaction mechanisms.
Advanced tools for catalyst characterization and theoretical/computational catalysis.

Proposals that deal with new catalytic materials, especially when viewed in light of the inherent complexity of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, will be enhanced by including plans to assess: 1) reproducibility and repeatability of data, 2) stability under realistic operating conditions including start-up and shut-down cycles, 3) performance relative to standard or well-known reference materials, and 4) quantitative, well-accepted measures of catalyst activity, selectivity, and catalytic efficiency, such as turnover frequencies, quantum and/or photon yields of photocatalysts, Faradaic efficiency of electrocatalytic reactions, and detailed product analyses and mass balances for the targeted application.
NOTE: Proposals that focus on 1) molecular or homogeneous catalysis, 2) the surface science of catalysis, 3) photo redox catalysis, 4) catalytic organic synthesis reactions, and/or 5) fine chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical applications of catalysis may be more appropriately submitted to the Chemical Catalysis program.(CHE 6884) in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Proposals focused on biocatalytic processes, including proposals focusing on enzyme engineering, cellular and biomolecular processes, should be submitted to the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program (CBET 1491). If the proposal focuses on reaction engineering aspects of catalytic processes, submit to the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program (CBET 1403). Projects that are interdisciplinary in nature may be jointly funded with other CBET and NSF programs. Program directors will review the submissions and may transfer your proposal to give it the best review situation.

"Cyberinfrastructure Technology Acceleration Pathway (CITAP)","The national cyberinfrastructure (CI) ecosystem is essential to computational- and data-intensive research across all science and engineering (S&E) domains. The CI ecosystem is highly dynamic, driven by rapid advances in a wide range of technologies, increasing volumes of highly heterogeneous data, and escalating demands for CI resources and services by the research community. Innovations in CI are consequently key catalysts for new modes of discovery and play a critical role in ensuring U.S. leadership in science, engineering, economic competitiveness, and national security, consistent with NSF's mission. It is thus imperative that CI innovations become available, in a coordinated and sustainable manner, as part of the NSF-funded advanced CI ecosystem.
The Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem of Support and Services (ACCESS) program provides an array of national-scale CI services to the S&E research community, including integrated coordination of users requests for computational and data resources; integration of resource providers systems; deployment of technical support; monitoring of system usage; user training; and communication and outreach to the CI and research communities. The ACCESS program is envisioned to include a process to enable breakthrough CI innovations of recognized value to researchers to be translated into production-quality sustained services that are deployed and made available to the user community from applicable NSF-funded resource providers. Such a process would also include methods to prioritize which innovations to translate to production services and to identify when these services should be taken out of service or replaced.  
This CITAP solicitation is focused on the translation of innovative research CI software  such as system software, libraries, application codes, and software enabling data services. NSF seeks proposals that aim to design, test, and subsequently operate a pathway service within the ACCESS program that manages and accelerates the translation of promising research CI software to production-quality services across the NSF advanced CI ecosystem in support of the NSF S&E research community. CITAP proposals are expected to create a new workflow process (represented notionally in Figure 1 below) within the ACCESS program that: (1) identifies novel CI software from diverse sources in a strongly community-informed way; (2) establishes an open and merit-based process for selecting and prioritizing/sequencing which of the identified innovations are of highest and most immediate value to users of the advanced CI ecosystem and can be feasibly translated to production level and made available for use by researchers using ACCESS resources; and (3) establishes an operational process that translates innovations into production services, including creation of partnerships where necessary to address each of the technical challenges and intellectual property (IP) considerations faced when integrating novel CI software within the advanced CI ecosystem.
Examples of translation challenges include (but are not limited to): awareness by potential users who could benefit from the technology; systems engineering and software deployment; an initial launch period of collaborative maintenance; anticipation of user support that will be necessary; engagement of people or possibly organizations needed to sustain and upgrade the software/service in response to changes in technology and/or feedback from users and communities served; and determination of when the relative use or value of the software has decreased to an extent that decommissioning is warranted. The pathway must also be designed to evolve as the types of systems and services that are part of the NSF-funded production advanced CI ecosystem evolve and expand.
 
Figure 1. Stepwise translation of innovative software into production services in NSFs advanced CI ecosystem, followed by optional collaborations for upgrades or spinoff enterprises.
CITAP proposals should assume the following three phases of development activities during the award period for the CITAP project: process design; pilot development and testing using CI translation use cases within the ACCESS program; and initial operations at scale. Advancement by the project to each subsequent phase will be based on successful associated milestone reviews that will assess the satisfaction of performance criteria defined for each phase that reflect the interests of key constituents, including S&E users, system administrators, and CI developers. During the initial operations phase, product launches will include a period of collaborative maintenance by the CITAP awardee and developers. Longer-term maintenance should also be planned to sustain and upgrade the technology.
Given the variety of sources of CI research and potential development partners, CITAP proposals are expected to promote the sustainability of the production software via collaboration with organizations or relevant NSF projects. Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) programs highlighted below are among those that foster development of CI technologies that are candidates for accelerated translation to production. Programs in OAC and in NSFs new Directorate for Technology, Innovations and Partnerships (TIP) support communities that may be suited to sustain or upgrade the production CI technologies.

"Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12)","The goal of the Discovery Research PreK-12 program (DRK-12) is to catalyze research and development that enhances all preK-12 teachers’ and students’ opportunities to engage in high-quality learning experiences related to the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The program’s objectives are to: (1) build knowledge about how to develop preK-12 students’ and teachers’ STEM content knowledge, practices, and skills; (2) support collaborative partnerships among STEM education researchers,  STEM education practitioners and school leaders with the goals of extending relevant scientific literatures while developing more effective practice; and (3) build the field of STEM education by supporting knowledge synthesis, interdisciplinary interactions across fields and stakeholders, and the development of novel and robust ways of assessing teacher and student learning, engagement, and skills. Outcomes of DRK-12 projects can include but are not limited to promising, evidence-based products that can be used by others to support the success of all teachers and all students (e.g., curriculum, teaching and research tools, and models of collaboration).
The program solicits proposals along two strands: (1) Learning and (2) Teaching. While these strands certainly overlap and have synergy, proposals should identify one strand that is most consistent with the proposal’s objectives and research questions (e.g., are the project’s methods and outcomes focused primarily on teacher development and teaching or student development and learning?). Research project types under both Strands include exploratory, design and development, impact, implementation, measurement and assessment, and synthesis studies. The program also supports other project types including Partnership Development Grants and Workshops/Conferences.
Successful proposals demonstrate how they build on fundamental research in STEM education and on previous or current applied research and development efforts. They also explain their theoretical and empirical justification (e.g., Why is the project designed as it is?) and outline related specific aims and methods with potential to yield new understandings of STEM teaching and learning contexts, processes, and outcomes. The program welcomes proposals focused on teaching and learning in any STEM field(s) and on priorities identified in the National Science Foundation’s strategic plan. Efforts focused on facilitating the reciprocal exchange or mobilization of knowledge between the research and preK-12 formal education professional communities are strongly encouraged (see this Dear Colleague Letter https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23078/nsf23078.jsp).","standard, continuing","2025-11-12, 2025-11-12",,500047,nsf23596,Cleared,2023-05-25,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/drk-12-discovery-research-prek-12/nsf23-596,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/drk-12-discovery-research-prek-12/nsf23-596/solicitation
"Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST Centers)","CREST Center awards provide support to enhance the research capabilities of Minority-serving institutions (MSIs) through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research. CREST Center awards promote the development of new knowledge, enhancements of the research productivity of individual faculty, and an expanded presence of students historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  
Successful CREST Center proposals will demonstrate a clear vision and integration of STEM research and education and will align with the mission of the Division of Equity for Excellence in STEM (EES) with respect to the development of a diverse STEM workforce. CREST Centers are also expected to provide leadership by meaningfully involving the efforts of those faculty, students, and postdoctoral researchers who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM at all levels. Centers are required to use evidence-based and innovative strategies to address salient broadening participation and workforce development issues, such as recruitment, retention, and mentorship of participants from underrepresented groups. Successful proposals are expected to achieve national research competitiveness, broaden participation in STEM, and generate sustained, non-CREST funding from federal, state, and/or private-sector sources.
Phase I and Phase II CREST Center Awards
Preliminary proposals are required for Phase I and Phase II projects. Thus, an invitation from NSF must be received before submitting a full proposal. Both Phase I and Phase II CREST Center awards provide multi-year support for institutions that demonstrate a strong research base. Phase I CREST Center awards provide funding for five years of research on a specific NSF-supported topic. If invited, institutions may submit a Phase II CREST Center proposal requesting funding to continue research in the same disciplinary area as the Phase I Center or may submit a Phase I proposal focused on a disciplinary area that is significantly different from those of the previous award(s).
CREST Partnership Supplements
CREST Partnership Supplemental funding requests are invited from current CREST Center awardees. Supplements support the establishment or strengthening of partnerships and collaborations with active CREST Centers and other nationally or internationally recognized research centers (including NSF-supported research centers), private sector research laboratories, K-12 schools, and/or informal science entities, including museums and science centers, as appropriate. Such partnerships and collaborations should aid CREST Centers’ quest in advancing knowledge and education on a research theme of national significance.","standard, continuing, other","2025-12-05, 2025-12-05",,506117,nsf23595,Cleared,2023-05-24,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/crest-centers-centers-research-excellence-science-technology/nsf23-595,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/crest-centers-centers-research-excellence-science-technology/nsf23-595/solicitation

"Community Infrastructure for Research in Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CIRC)","The Community Infrastructure for Research in Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CIRC) program drives discovery and learning in the core disciplines of the three participating CISE divisions [Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF), Computer and Network Systems (CNS), and Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS)] of the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) by funding the creation and enhancement of world-class research infrastructure. This research infrastructure will specifically support diverse communities of CISE researchers pursuing focused research agendas in computer and information science and engineering. This support involves developing the accompanying user services and engagement needed to attract, nurture, and grow a robust research community that is actively involved in determining directions for the infrastructure, as well as management of the infrastructure. This should lead to research infrastructure that can be sustained through community involvement and community leadership, and that will enable advances not possible with existing research infrastructure. Further, through the CIRC program, CISE seeks to ensure that researchers from a diverse range of institutions of higher education (IHEs), including minority-serving and predominantly undergraduate institutions, as well as researchers from non-profit, non-academic organizations, have access to such infrastructure.
The CIRC program supports four classes of awards:

Planning Community Infrastructure (Planning) awards support planning efforts to engage research communities to develop new CISE community research infrastructures. Such an infrastructure could be eventually funded through the CIRC program (Planning-C) or the NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure (MsRI) program (Planning-M). For the scope of Mid-scale RI proposals, see the Mid-scale RI-1 and Mid-scale RI-2 program pages.
Exploratory Development (Dev) awards support activities that involve the validation of one or more unproven infrastructure designs and/or technologies, which, if validated, could enable transformative community research infrastructure in the future. Successful projects are expected to provide the technical foundations necessary to pursue subsequent CIRC (New or Grand), Mid-scale RI-1, or Mid-scale RI-2 projects.
Medium Community Infrastructure (Medium) awards support the creation of new CISE community research infrastructure or the enhancement of existing CISE community research infrastructure with integrated tools, resources, user services, and research community outreach to enable innovative CISE research opportunities to advance the frontiers of the CISE core research areas. The Medium award class includes New (New) and Enhance/Sustain (ENS) awards.
Grand Community Infrastructure (Grand) awards support projects involving significant efforts to develop new CISE community research infrastructure or to enhance and sustain an existing CISE community research infrastructure to enable world-class CISE research opportunities for broad-based communities of CISE researchers that extend well beyond the awardee organization(s).

Each CIRC Medium or Grand award may include support for operation of the infrastructure, ensuring that the awardee organization(s) is (are) well positioned to provide a high quality of service to CISE community researchers expected to use the infrastructure to realize their research goals.","standard, continuing, coop","2025-09-12, 2025-09-12",,12810,nsf23589,Cleared,2023-05-12,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/circ-community-infrastructure-research-computer-information/nsf23-589,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/circ-community-infrastructure-research-computer-information/nsf23-589/solicitation

"IUSE: Innovation in Two-Year College STEM Education (ITYC)","The National Science Foundation (NSF) plays a prominent role in the improvement of undergraduate STEM education at the Nation’s colleges and universities.  Through the IUSE: Innovation in Two-Year College STEM Education (ITYC) program, the agency seeks to extend this effort by making an intentional investment in the country’s two-year institutions of higher education, or two-year colleges. The twin goals of the ITYC program are to (1) center students in the effort to advance innovation, promote equitable outcomes and broaden participation for all students in STEM education at two-year colleges, and (2) enhance the capacity of two-year colleges to harness the talent and potential of their diverse student and faculty population through innovative disciplinary, multi-department, and college-wide efforts. These goals will be achieved by investing in projects at two-year colleges that contribute to student success in STEM-based foundational courses and academic pathways for both majors and non-majors. Project activities may be in any discipline that is currently supported by NSF funding, which includes the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. Collectively, projects in the ITYC program will make progress towards ensuring that two-year college students and faculty have the resources to fully participate in and contribute to the broader STEM enterprise.
Aligned with the goals above, the ITYC program features two tracks: (1) A Focus on the Academic Experiences of Two-Year College Students and (2) Leveraging Institutional Strengths and Innovation. Each Track can support projects requesting up to $500,000 for a duration of up to three years.  For institutions that have not received NSF funding in the past five years, an additional $100,000 may be added to the budget which may be used by the institution to support and carry out grant-funded activities over four years.  This would result in a total maximum budget of $600,000 for a project over four years.   Institutions that have been funded as part of a collaborative award with their own NSF Award Number are not eligible for this incentive, however, institutions that have had a subaward from another institution are eligible.
This program is open to two-year colleges, which includes the following institutions, as described by Carnegie Classifications:

Associate’s Colleges:  Institutions at which the highest-level degree awarded is an associate degree.  This may include transfer as well a career and technical oriented colleges.
Baccalaureate / Associate’s Colleges:  Institutions that award at least one baccalaureate degree but confer at least 50% of their degrees at the associate level.

"Computer and Information Science and Engineering Research Initiation Initiative (CRII)","The NSF Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) seeks to award grants intended to support research independence among early-career academicians who specifically lack access to adequate organizational or other resources, and to broaden the set of institutions capable of performing computing research. It is expected that funds obtained through this program will be used to support untenured faculty or research scientists (or equivalent) in their first three years in a primary academic position after the PhD, but not more than six years after completion of their PhD. Applicants for this program may not yet have received any other grants or contracts in the PI role from any department, agency, or institution of the federal government, including from the CAREER program or any other program, post-PhD, regardless of the size of the grant or contract, with certain exceptions as noted below. Serving as co-PI, Senior Personnel, Postdoctoral Fellow, or other Fellow does not count against this eligibility rule.
Importantly, the CRII program seeks to provide essential resources to enable early-career PIs to launch their research careers. This funding opportunity also aims to broaden the engagement of investigators in CISE research and therefore is limited to investigators that are either (1) affiliated with an Institution of Higher Education that is not a ""very high research activity"" R1 institution (according to the Carnegie Classification https://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/) or (2) non-profit non-academic institutions. Faculty at undergraduate and two-year institutions may use funds to support undergraduate students, and may optionally use the additional RUI designation (which requires inclusion of a RUI Certification and RUI Impact Statement) -- see https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5518 for additional information.

"CyberCorps Scholarship for Service (SFS)","Cyberspace has transformed the daily lives of people. Society's overwhelming reliance on cyberspace, however, has exposed the system's fragility and vulnerabilities: corporations, agencies, national infrastructure, and individuals continue to suffer cyber-attacks. Achieving a truly secure cyberspace requires addressing both challenging scientific and engineering problems involving many components of a system, and vulnerabilities that stem from human behaviors and choices. Examining the fundamentals of security and privacy as a multidisciplinary subject can lead to fundamentally new ways to design, build, and operate cyber systems, protect existing infrastructure, and motivate individuals to learn about cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014, as amended by the National Defense Authorization Acts for 2018 and 2021, and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, authorizes the National Science Foundation (NSF), in coordination with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to offer a scholarship program to recruit and train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals to meet the needs of the cybersecurity mission of federal, state, local, and tribal governments. The goals of the CyberCorps® Scholarship for Service (SFS) program are aligned with the U.S. strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. The program goals are to: (1) increase the number of qualified and diverse cybersecurity candidates for government cybersecurity positions; (2) improve the national capacity for the education of cybersecurity professionals and research and development workforce; (3) hire, monitor, and retain high-quality CyberCorps® graduates in the cybersecurity mission of the Federal Government; and (4) strengthen partnerships between institutions of higher education and federal, state, local, and tribal governments. While all three agencies work together on all four goals, NSF’s strength is in the first two goals; OPM’s in goal (3); and DHS in goal (4).
The SFS Program welcomes proposals to establish or to continue scholarship programs in cybersecurity. A proposing institution must provide clearly documented evidence of a strong existing academic program in cybersecurity. In addition to information provided in the proposal narrative, such evidence can include ABET accreditation in cybersecurity; a designation by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security as a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education (CAE-CDE), in Cyber Operations (CAE-CO) or in Research (CAE-R); or equivalent evidence documenting a strong program in cybersecurity.
Service Obligation: All scholarship recipients must work after graduation in the cybersecurity mission of a federal, state, local, or tribal government organization, or certain other qualifying entities, for a period equal to at least the length of the scholarship.
The SFS Program also supports efforts leading to an increase in the ability of the United States higher education enterprise to produce cybersecurity professionals. Funding opportunities in this area are provided via the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace - Education Designation (SaTC-EDU) and other programs (see the section ""Increasing National Capacity in Cybersecurity Education"" for more details.)",continuing,"2025-07-15, 2025-07-15",,504991,nsf23574,Cleared,2023-04-04,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/sfs-cybercorps-scholarship-service/nsf23-574,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/sfs-cybercorps-scholarship-service/nsf23-574/solicitation
"Archaeometry (AMTRY)","The Archaeology Program administers an annual Archaeometry competition with a target date of December 1. The goal is to fund projects in two main categories:

To develop or refine anthropologically relevant archaeometric techniques. Examples include the development of methods to identify specific types of organic residues on ceramics or development of field applicable analytic techniques.
To support laboratories which provide relevant services. This includes support of service laboratories which, for example, may provide dating trace element, isotopic and dendrochronological analyses. It also includes support for data archives, which function to strengthen basic archaeological infrastructure.

Projects which apply standard archaeometic techniques with the goal to answer specific archaeological questions should be submitted to the Archaeology Senior Research Awards competition.

"Environmental Sustainability","The Environmental Sustainability program is part of the Environmental Engineering and Sustainability cluster together with 1) the Environmental Engineering program and 2) the Nanoscale Interactions program.
The goal of the Environmental Sustainability program is to promote sustainable engineered systems that support human well-being and that are also compatible with sustaining natural (environmental) systems. These systems provide ecological services vital for human survival. Research efforts supported by the program typically consider long time horizons and may incorporate contributions from the social sciences and ethics. The program supports engineering research that seeks to balance society's need to provide ecological protection and maintain stable economic conditions.
There are five principal general research areas that are supported.

Circular Bioeconomy Engineering: This area includes research that enables sustainable societal use of food, energy, water, nitrogen, phosphorus, and materials, with the reduction and eventual elimination of fossil fuel combustion that lacks carbon capture. The program encourages research that helps build the raw material basis for the functioning of society principally on biomass, drawing heavily on sustainable agriculture and forestry. Additionally, material flows must reduce or preferably eliminate waste, with an emphasis on closed-loop or “circular” processing.
Industrial ecology: Topics of interest include advancements in modeling such as life cycle assessment, materials flow analysis, net energy analysis, input/output economic models, and novel metrics for measuring sustainable systems. Innovations in industrial ecology are encouraged.
Green engineering: Research is encouraged to advance the sustainability of manufacturing processes, green buildings, and infrastructure. Many programs in the Engineering Directorate support research in environmentally benign manufacturing or chemical processes. The Environmental Sustainability program supports research that would affect more than one chemical or manufacturing process or that takes a systems or holistic approach to green engineering for infrastructure or green buildings. Improvements in distribution and collection systems that will advance smart growth strategies and ameliorate effects of growth are research areas that are supported by Environmental Sustainability. Innovations in management of storm water, recycling and reuse of drinking water, and other green engineering techniques to support sustainability may also be fruitful areas for research.
Ecological engineering: Proposals should focus on the engineering aspects of restoring ecological function to natural systems. Engineering research in the enhancement of natural capital to foster sustainable development is encouraged.
Earth systems engineering: Earth systems engineering considers aspects of large-scale engineering research that involve mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation to climate change, and other global concerns.

All proposed research should be driven by engineering principles, and be presented explicitly in an environmental sustainability context. Proposals should include involvement in engineering research of at least one graduate student, as well as undergraduates. Incorporation of aspects of social, behavioral, and economic sciences is welcomed.
NOTE: Water treatment, air pollution (both outdoor and indoor), soil remediation, and solid waste treatment proposals are to be submitted to the Environmental Engineering program (CBET 1440).
Innovative proposals outside the scope of the four core areas mentioned above may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review. For proposals that call for research to be done on regions that are outside of the United States, an explanation must be presented of the potential benefit of the research for the United States.

"Nanoscale Interactions","The Nanoscale Interactions program is part of the Environmental Engineering and Sustainability cluster, which also includes: 1) the Environmental Engineering program; and 2) the Environmental Sustainability program.
The goal of the Nanoscale Interactions program is to support research to advance fundamental and quantitative understanding of the interactions of nanomaterials and nanosystems with biological and environmental media.
Materials of interest include one- to three-dimensional nanostructures, heterogeneous nano-bio hybrid assemblies, dendritic and micelle structures, quantum dots, and other nanoparticles. Such nanomaterials and systems frequently exhibit novel physical, chemical, photonic, electronic, and biological behavior as compared to the bulk scale.  Collaborative and interdisciplinary proposals are encouraged.
Research areas supported by the program include:

Characterization of interactions at the interfaces of nanomaterials and nanosystems, including both simple nanoparticles and complex and/or heterogeneous composites and nanosystems, with surrounding biological and environmental media;
Development of predictive tools based on the fundamental behavior of nanostructures to advance cost-effective and environmentally benign processing and engineering solutions over full-life material cycles;
Examination of the transport, interaction, and impact of nanostructured materials and nanosystems on biological systems and the environment;
Simulations of nanoparticle behavior at interfaces, in conjunction with experimental comparisons, and new theories and simulation approaches for determining the transport and transformation of nanoparticles in various media; and
Investigations of quantum vibronic and spin phenomena with correlations to nano phenomena.

The Nanoscale Interactions program will support exploratory research projects on nanoscale interactions of quantum effects which explain macroscopic changes and physiological and metabolic processes; investigate quantum vibration and electron spin to elucidate nano phenomena and produce quantitative data and evidence of quantum effects.
Research in these areas will enable the design of nanostructured materials and heterogeneous nanosystems with desired chemical, electronic, photonic, biological, and mechanical properties for optimal and sustainable handling, manufacture, and utilization.
NOTE: Studies that focus on fundamental research concerning atomic- and molecular-scale interfacial phenomena and engineering of interfacial properties, processes, and materials, particularly as relevant towards advancing industrial chemical or biochemical processes, may be more appropriate for the Interfacial Engineering program (CBET 1417). Please consult with program directors prior to submission if you have questions about programmatic fit.

"Interfacial Engineering","The Interfacial Engineering program is part of the Chemical Process Systems cluster, which also includes: 1) the Catalysis program; 2) the Electrochemical Systems program; and 3) the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program.
The goal of the Interfacial Engineering program is to support fundamental research on atomic- and molecular-scale interfacial phenomena and engineering of interfacial properties, processes, and materials. Fundamental understanding of the thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport properties of interfacial systems underpins improvements in chemical process efficiency and resource utilization. As such, proposed research should have a clear vision for how the results will translate to practice in or otherwise advance industrial chemical or biochemical processes. The program encourages proposals that present new approaches to long-standing challenges or address emerging research areas and technologies. Collaborative and interdisciplinary proposals are also encouraged, particularly those that involve a combination of experiment with theory or modeling.
Major research areas of interest in the program include:

Chemical separations: Design of scalable mass separating agents (for example, sorbents and membranes); field-induced separation processes that target a significant reduction in energy and/or materials requirements
Biological separations: Downstream processing of biologically-derived chemicals, therapeutic proteins, and biologics for increased throughput and purity; engineering interfaces for molecular recognition
Interfacial phenomena at engineered interfaces and surfaces: Kinetics and thermodynamics of adsorption/desorption and complex interactions of molecules and ions at engineered interfaces and surfaces within chemical process systems
Nanoconfinement and engineered surfaces: Theory, modeling, and/or approaches for examining transport and thermodynamic properties of fluids within nanopores, under nanoconfinement, or at highly engineered surfaces within chemical process systems

NOTE: Studies that examine chemical reaction and transport phenomena related to electrochemical system performance, including batteries, fuel cells, flow batteries, electrochemical conversions, and related components, should be directed to the Electrochemical Systems program (CBET 7644). Studies that focus on interactions of nanomaterials and nanosystems, particularly as relevant to environmental or biological applications, may be more appropriate for the Nanoscale Interactions program (CBET 1179). Studies of how interfacial dynamics affect transport or bulk properties of multiphase systems may be more appropriate for the Particulate and Multiphase Processes program (CBET 1415). Please consult with program directors prior to submission if you have questions about programmatic fit.

"Electrochemical Systems","The Electrochemical Systems program is part of the Chemical Process Systems cluster, which also includes: 1) the Catalysis program; 2) the Interfacial Engineering program; and 3) the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program.
The goal of the Electrochemical Systems program is to support fundamental engineering science research that will enable innovative processes involving electrochemistry or photochemistry for the sustainable production of electricity, fuels, chemicals, and other specialty and commodity products. Processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry for sustainable energy and chemical production must be scalable, environmentally benign, reduce greenhouse gas production, and utilize renewable resources. Research projects that stress fundamental understanding of phenomena that directly impact key barriers to improved system or component-level performance (for example, energy efficiency, product yield, process intensification) are encouraged. Processes for energy storage should address fundamental research barriers for renewable electricity storage applications, for transport propulsion, or for other applications that could have impact towards climate change mitigation. For projects concerning energy storage materials, proposals should involve testable hypotheses that involve device or component performance characteristics that are tied to fundamental understanding of transport, kinetics, or thermodynamics. Advanced chemistries beyond lithium-ion are encouraged. Proposed research on processes utilizing electrochemistry or photochemistry should be inspired by the need for economic and impactful conversion processes.
All proposal project descriptions should address how the proposed work, if successful, will improve process realization and economic feasibility and compare the proposed work against current state of the art. Highly integrated multidisciplinary projects are encouraged. When appropriate, collaborations with industrial technologists are encouraged through GOALI proposals. Collaborative projects with an integrated experimental and theoretical approach are also encouraged.
Topics of interest include electrochemical energy storage and electrochemical production/conversion systems. Radically new battery systems can move the U.S. more rapidly toward a more sustainable transportation future and to greater renewable electricity production penetration. High-energy density and high-power density batteries suitable for transportation and renewable energy storage applications are of primary interest. Advanced systems involving metal anodes, solid-state electrolytes, nonaqueous systems beyond lithium, aqueous systems beyond lithium, and multivalent chemistries are encouraged. Research activities focused on commercially available systems such as lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride batteries or lithium-ion batteries for medical or consumer electronics applications will not be considered by this program. Novel electrochemical and photochemical systems and processes for the production of chemicals and high-value products are encouraged. Emphasis is placed on those systems that improve process intensification and process modularization with accompanying benefits in energy efficiency and environmental footprint.
Additional fundamental science topics of interest to this program include the study of:

advanced fuel cell systems or fuel cell components for transportation propulsion or grid energy storage applications;
flow batteries for stationary energy storage applications including alternative redox chemistries (e.g., organic, inorganic, organometallic, macromolecular) and operating strategies (e.g., redox-mediation, suspensions); and
photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical processes and devices for the splitting of water into hydrogen gas or for the reduction of carbon dioxide to liquid or gaseous fuels. Projects that largely focus on developing fundamental understanding of the catalytic reaction mechanisms and structure-function relationships may be more appropriate as submissions to the CBET Catalysis program (CBET 1401).

Projects submitted to the Electrochemical Systems program are expected to develop fundamental, molecular-level understanding of the key chemical reaction and transport phenomena barriers to improved system-level performance. Innovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.

"Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-2 (Mid-scale RI-2)","NSF-supported science and engineering research increasingly relies on cutting-edge infrastructure. With its Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and Major Multi-user Research Facility projects (Major Facilities), NSF supports infrastructure projects at the lower and higher ends of infrastructure scales across science and engineering research disciplines. The Mid-scale Research Infrastructure Programs are intended to provide NSF with an agile, Foundation-wide process to fund experimental research capabilities in the mid-scale range between the MRI and Major Facilities  thresholds. In alignment with NSF’s goal to bring together diverse disciplinary perspectives to support convergent research, proposals submitted in response to this solicitation will be managed by a cross-disciplinary team of NSF Program Directors.
NSF defines Research Infrastructure (RI) as any combination of facilities, equipment, instrumentation, or computational hardware or software, and the necessary human capital in support of the same. Major facilities and mid-scale projects are subsets of research infrastructure. The NSF Mid-scale RI-2 Program supports the implementation of unique and compelling RI projects.  Mid-scale RI-2 projects may include any combination of equipment, instrumentation, cyberinfrastructure, broadly used large-scale data sets, and the commissioning and/or personnel needed to successfully complete the project.  Mid-scale RI-2 projects should fill a research community-defined scientific need, or address an identified national research priority, that enables current and next-generation U.S. researchers and a diverse STEM workforce to remain competitive in a global research environment.  Mid-scale RI-2 projects will directly enable advances in any of the research domains supported by NSF, including STEM education research, and translational research. Projects may also include upgrades to existing research infrastructure.  The total cost for Mid-scale RI-2 projects ranges from $20 million to below the threshold for a Major Facility Project, currently $100 million. Preliminary and full proposals to the Mid-scale RI-2 Program with total project costs outside this solicitation's budgetary limits will be returned without review.
The Mid-scale RI-2 Program emphasizes projects that have strong scientific merit, respond to an identified need of the research community, demonstrate technical and project management readiness for implementation, include a well-developed plan for student training in all activities leading to and including the implementation of the mid-scale research infrastructure, and involve a diverse workforce in mid-scale research infrastructure development, and/or associated data management. Training of students in design and implementation of the research infrastructure is essential. 
The Mid-scale RI-2 Program seeks to broaden the representation of PIs and institutions in its award portfolio, including a geographically diverse set of institutions (especially those in EPSCoR jurisdictions). PIs who are women, early-career researchers, members of groups that are underrepresented in STEM, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to apply.  To improve participation in science and engineering research for persons with disabilities, Mid-scale RI-2 encourages PIs to incorporate accessibility as part of a Mid-scale RI-2 project. 
Please consult NSF’s Research Infrastructure Guide (RIG) NSF 21-107, (formerly the Major Facilities Guide) for definitions of certain terms used in this solicitation, such as the Project Execution Plan (PEP).  Section 5 of the RIG provides guidance specific to Mid-scale Research Infrastructure Projects, including references to other parts of the RIG, as needed. Note that the PEP should be appropriately scaled for the complexity of the project and may not require all of the elements described in the RIG, Section 4. Project teams are strongly encouraged to include professional project management expertise at the earliest stages of proposal development.
Mid-scale RI-2 will consider only the implementation (typically construction or acquisition) stage of a project, including a limited degree of final development or necessary production design immediately preparatory to implementation. It is thus intended that Mid-scale RI-2 will support projects in well-developed states of project management and technical readiness for implementation, i.e., those that have already matured through previous developmental investments. Accordingly, Mid-scale RI-2 does not support pre-implementation (early-stage design or development) activities. Mid-scale RI-2 also does not support post-implementation research, operations or maintenance, the anticipated source(s) of support for which are expected to be discussed in the proposal.
Note: Research infrastructure and instrumentation in the range just above the current Major Research Instrumentation Program threshold and below the Mid-scale RI-2 threshold is the subject of the Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-1 solicitation (NSF 22-637). ",coop,,,505550,nsf23570,Cleared,2023-03-20,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/mid-scale-ri-2-mid-scale-research-infrastructure-2/nsf23-570,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/mid-scale-ri-2-mid-scale-research-infrastructure-2/nsf23-570/solicitation
"A Science of Science Approach to Analyzing and Innovating the Biomedical Research Enterprise (SoS:BIO)","The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are interested in proposals that will propel our understanding of the biomedical research enterprise by drawing from the scientific expertise of the science of science policy research community.
NSF promotes the progress of science by maintaining the general health of research and education across all fields of science and engineering. The Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) Directorate within NSF supports basic research on people and society. The SBE sciences focus on human behavior and social organizations; how social, economic, political, cultural and environmental forces affect the lives of people from birth to old age; and how people in turn shape those forces. SBE's Science of Science: Discovery, Communication and Impact Program (SoS:DCI) supports research designed to advance the scientific basis of science and innovation policy.
The NIH is the U.S. federal agency charged with supporting biomedical research in the U.S. The National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) within the NIH supports basic biomedical research that increases understanding of biological processes and lays the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention. 
Both NSF and NIH believe that there are opportunities and needs for building and supporting research projects with a focus on the scientific research enterprise. The two agencies also recognize that when programmatic goals are compatible, coordinated management and funding of a research program can have a positive synergistic effect on the level and scope of research and can leverage the investments of both agencies. 
Therefore, NIGMS and SBE are partnering to enable collaboration in research between the SoS:DCI program and NIGMS. This partnership will result in a portfolio of high-quality research to provide scientific analysis of important aspects of the biomedical research enterprise and efforts to foster a diverse, innovative, productive and efficient scientific workforce, from which future scientific leaders will emerge.  
Prospective investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their proposals with the program officers before submission to determine project relevance to the priorities of both SBE and NIGMS. Specific questions pertaining to this solicitation can also be directed to the SBE and NIGMS program officers.","standard, continuing","2025-09-09, 2025-09-09",,505610,nsf23569,Cleared,2023-03-20,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/sosbio-science-science-approach-analyzing-innovating-biomedical/nsf23-569,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/sosbio-science-science-approach-analyzing-innovating-biomedical/nsf23-569/solicitation

"Human Networks and Data Science (HNDS)","The Human Networks and Data Science program (HNDS) supports research that enhances understanding of human behavior by leveraging data and network science research across a broad range of topics. HNDS research will identify ways in which dynamic, distributed, or heterogeneous data can provide novel answers to fundamental questions about individual or group behavior. HNDS is especially interested in proposals that provide data-rich insights about human networks to support improved health, prosperity, and security.
HNDS has two tracks:
(1) Human Networks and Data Science – Infrastructure (HNDS-I). Infrastructure proposals will address the development of data resources and relevant analytic techniques that support fundamental Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) research. Successful infrastructure proposals will construct, within the financial resources provided by the award, databases or relevant analytic techniques and produce a finished product that will enable previously impossible data-intensive research in the social sciences. The databases or techniques should have significant impacts, either across multiple fields or within broad disciplinary areas, by making possible new types of data-intensive research in the SBE sciences.
(2) Human Networks and Data Science – Core Research (HNDS-R). Core research proposals will advance theory in a core SBE discipline by the application of data and network science methods. This includes the leveraging of large data sets with diverse spatio-temporal scales of measurement and linked qualitative and quantitative approaches, as well as multi-scale, multi-level network data and techniques of network analysis.

"Fluid Dynamics","The Fluid Dynamics program is part of the Transport Phenomena cluster, which also includes 1) the Combustion and Fire Systems program; 2) the Particulate and Multiphase Processes program; and 3) the Thermal Transport Processes program.
The Fluid Dynamics program supports fundamental research toward gaining an understanding of the physics of various fluid dynamics phenomena. Proposed research should contribute to basic scientific understanding via experiments, theoretical developments, and computational discovery.
Major areas of interest and activity in the program include:

Turbulence and transition: High Reynolds number experiments; large eddy simulation; direct numerical simulation; transition to turbulence; 3-D boundary layers; separated flows; multi-phase turbulent flows; flow control and drag reduction. High-speed boundary layer transition and turbulence at Mach numbers greater than 5 to understand modal and/or non-modal interactions leading to boundary layer transition and the ensuing developing and fully developed turbulent boundary layer flows. Combined experiments and simulations are encouraged.
Bio-fluid physics: Bio-inspired flows; biological flows with emphasis on flow physics.
Non-Newtonian fluid mechanics: Single-phase viscoelastic flows; solutions of macro-molecules.
Bubble dynamics: Bubbles related to cavitation and/or drag reduction or impacting the fluid viscosity (locally) or manipulation of bubbles with external excitation (acoustofluidics).
Microfluidics and nanofluidics: Micro-and nano-scale flow physics. 
Wind and ocean energy harvesting: Focused on fundamental fluid dynamics associated with renewable energy. The NSF-DOE (Department of Energy) joint funding area is focused on high Reynolds number aerodynamics of thick airfoils (> 21% thickness/chord) operating in complex (3D) steady, unsteady, and separated flows. Impacts of blade surface quality/roughness rotor performance on the aerodynamic/aeroelastic performance of novel rotor geometries and supporting structures are also of interest. Air/sea interactions, including waves/currents, on the hydrodynamic loading for offshore wind turbines. Improved measurement techniques and sensing/control technologies required to characterize the metocean environment impact on performance. The DoE participates in this initiative through the Wind Energy Technologies Office (program manager Michael Derby, email: michael.derby@ee.doe.gov). 
Fluid-structure interactions: General FSI applications across the low- to high-Reynolds number range are of interest to NSF. In addition, NSF-AFOSR (Air Force Office of Scientific Research) joint funding area is focused on theory, modeling and/or experiments for hypersonic applications. AFOSR participates in this initiative through the Aerothermodynamics program.
Canonical configurations: Experimental research is encouraged to develop spatiotemporally resolved databases for canonical configurations to either confirm historical results or to provide data in an unexplored parameter region. Fidelity and completeness for theoretical/computational validation is a key attribute of the proposed experimental data.
Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning: Innovative AI ideas related to the use of machine learning and other AI approaches in fluid dynamics research to model and control the flows are encouraged. Verifying new models with canonical configurations, when appropriate, is encouraged for the Computational and Data-Enabled Science & Engineering (CDS&E) program.
Instrumentation and Flow Diagnostics: Instrument development for time-space resolved measurements; shear stress sensors; novel flow imaging; and velocimetry.

NOTE: Proposals that use fluid flows as a boundary input condition or a driving force in a problem do not fit within the scope of this program. Proposals focused on particulates (including droplets) two-way coupled with fluids, colloids, and multiphase rheology and processes should be directed to the Particulate and Multiphase Processes program. Proposals dealing mainly with materials synthesis, processing and characterization may be more suitable for the Advanced Manufacturing program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation or programs in the Division of Materials Research. Proposals dealing primarily with sensors and controls may be more suitable for the Dynamics, Controls, & Cognition program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation. Proposals focused on biological systems may be more suitable for Physiological and Structural Systems in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.

"Growing Research Access for Nationally Transformative Economic Development (GRANTED)","GRANTED supports ambitious ideas and innovative strategies to address challenges and inequalities within the research enterprise. The research enterprise is broadly defined and includes administrative support and service infrastructure such as, but not limited to, human capital, research development and administration, research analytics, technology transfer and commercialization, corporate relations/public-private partnerships, research integrity, compliance and security, research policy, administration of student research training, and research leadership. Strengthening this administrative infrastructure supporting research and STEM training is necessary to fully utilize the Nation's talent and capabilities and empower America's organizations that engage in or support research, to participate in a diverse, equitable, and internationally competitive research enterprise.
Program Description
A strong national research enterprise relies on more than funding for the research itself. It also requires robust administrative support and service infrastructure, which is often unseen, yet includes critical components of the research enterprise. This infrastructure enables the development of proposals and management of awards. It supports broader impacts activities through technology transfer, public-private partnerships and community engaged research. Policy and process guides research compliance and enables the security and integrity of the work. Research analytics and communication, managing the training of our scientific workforce, and harnessing the creativity and drive of research leadership, and more, are fundamental components of the infrastructure. Access to, and provisioning of, administrative infrastructure varies significantly among organizations in research, resulting in structural barriers that impede broad participation in the Nation's research and discovery opportunities. Securing global leadership demands we act together to transform the research enterprise to be more resilient, sustainable, equitable, and diverse.
The GRANTED initiative provides unique opportunities to realize this vision for research enterprise infrastructure. Proposals in response to this GRANTED program description should be broadly inclusive and engage the professional, administrative research support and service workforce in project leadership roles described within proposals. Proposed projects should look beyond individual and discipline-specific research needs and focus on activities that create institution/organization-wide impact. Projects that identify nationally scalable models to build and sustain research enterprise infrastructure are strongly encouraged.  Competitive proposals will recognize structural challenges and include goals to implement interventions, solutions, and/or strategies that will mitigate the challenges and broaden participation. Proposals must be centered around one or more of the three main themes of GRANTED:


Enhancing practices and processes within the research enterprise;


Developing and strengthening human capital within the research enterprise;


Translating effective practices related to the research enterprise into diverse institutional and organizational contexts through partnerships with professional societies and organizations.


All types of institutions and organizations engaged, or aspiring to be engaged, in the research enterprise are invited to participate, as described in the current NSF Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide (PAPPG) Part 1/Chapter 1, Section E. Prospective PIs are strongly encouraged to contact GRANTED initiative personnel (GRANTED@nsf.gov) with inquiries prior to developing and submitting a proposal to this program description. The project budget and duration should be determined by the scope of the proposed activities and presented in accordance with the PAPPG. GRANTED is not intended to fund discipline-specific STEM research and training projects.
Collectively, proposals funded through this Program Description will: 1) advance transformation of the national research enterprise, 2) generate scalable models that mitigate structural barriers and expand research capacity and competitiveness, 3) create new and authentic collaborations, partnerships, and communities centered around strengthening the Nation's research enterprise, 4) diversify the project leadership, institutions, ideas, and approaches that NSF funds, and 5) broaden participation in the Nation's research enterprise.",,,1,506178,pd23221Y,Cleared,2023-02-15,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/granted-growing-research-access-nationally-transformative-economic/pd23-221y,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/policies/pappg

"Scholarships in STEM Network (S-STEM-Net)","Through this solicitation, NSF seeks to foster a network of S-STEM stakeholders and further develop the infrastructure needed to generate and disseminate new knowledge, successful practices and effective design principles arising from NSF S-STEM projects nationwide. The ultimate vision of the legislation governing the S-STEM parent program[1] (and of the current S-STEM-Net solicitation) is that all Americans, regardless of economic status, should be able to contribute to the American innovation economy if they so desire.
To support collaboration within the S-STEM network, NSF will fund several S-STEM Research Hubs (S-STEM-Hub). The S-STEM Network (S-STEM-Net) will collaborate to create synergies and sustain a robust national ecosystem consisting of multi-sector partners supporting domestic low-income STEM students in achieving their career goals, while also ensuring access, inclusion, and adaptability to changing learning needs. The Hubs will investigate evolving barriers to the success of this student population. It will also disseminate the context and circumstances by which interventions and practices that support graduation of domestic low-income students (both undergraduate and graduate) pursuing careers in STEM are successful.
The target audience for this dissemination effort is the community of higher education institutions, faculty, scholars, researchers and evaluators, local and regional organizations, industry, and other nonprofit, federal, state, and local agencies concerned with the success of domestic low-income STEM students in the United States.

The funded activities, spanning targeted, multidisciplinary communities, should lead to transformative changes in the state of research workforce preparedness for advanced CI-enabled research in the short- and long-term. This solicitation also seeks to broaden CI access and adoption by (i) increasing the adoption of advanced CI and computational and data-driven methods to a broader range of S&E disciplines and institutions and (ii) effectively utilizing the capabilities of individuals from a diverse set of underrepresented groups. Proposals from, and in partnership with, the aforementioned communities are especially encouraged.
There are two project classes as defined below:

Pilot Projects: up to $300,000 total budget with durations up to two years; and
Implementation Projects: Small (with total budgets of up to $500,000) or Medium (with total budgets of up to $1,000,000) for durations of up to four years.

Section II. Program Description provides a more complete description of the project classes. Section V.A. Proposal Preparation Instructions describes the proposal elements required for the various project classes in order to address the suitable set of solicitation-specific review criteria.
The CyberTraining program is led by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and has participation from other NSF directorates/divisions, as described in Section II. Program Description, Programmatic Areas of Interest. Not all directorates/divisions are participating at the same level, and some have specific research and education priorities. The appropriate contact for the CyberTraining program in any directorate/division is the Cognizant Program Officer (PO) for the respective directorate/division/office/program listed below.
All projects are expected to clearly articulate how they will address important community needs, provide resources that will be widely available to and usable by the research community, and broaden participation from underrepresented groups. Prospective principal investigators (PIs) are strongly encouraged to contact the Cognizant Program Officers in CISE/OAC and in the participating directorate/division relevant to the proposal to ascertain whether the focus and budget of their proposed activities are appropriate for this solicitation. Such consultations should be completed at least one month in advance of the submission deadline. PIs should include the names of the Cognizant Program Officers consulted in a Single Copy Document as described in Section V.A. Proposal Preparation Instructions. The intent of the CyberTraining program is to encourage collaboration between CI and S&E domain disciplines. (For this purpose, units of CISE other than OAC are considered domain disciplines.) To ensure relevance to community needs and to facilitate adoption, those proposals of interest to one or more domain divisions must include at least one PI/co-PI with expertise relevant to the targeted research discipline. All proposals shall include at least one PI/co-PI with expertise relevant to OAC.

"Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI)","The Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program (MRI Program Website) serves to increase access to multi-user scientific and engineering instrumentation for research and research training in our Nation's institutions of higher education and not-for-profit scientific/engineering research organizations. An MRI award supports the acquisition of a multi-user research instrument that is commercially available through direct purchase from a vendor, or for the personnel costs and equipment that are required for the development of an instrument with new capabilities, thereby advancing instrumentation capabilities and enhancing expertise for instrument design and fabrication at academic institutions. MRI instruments are, in general, too costly and/or not appropriate for support through other NSF programs.
MRI provides support to acquire critical research instrumentation without which advances in fundamental science and engineering research may not otherwise occur. MRI also provides support to obtain next-generation research instruments by developing instruments with new capabilities that open new opportunities to advance the frontiers in science and engineering research. Additionally, an MRI award is expected to enhance research training of students who will become the next generation of instrument users, designers and builders.
An MRI proposal may request from NSF up to $4 million for either acquisition or development of a research instrument. Each performing organization may submit in revised ""Tracks"" as defined below, with no more than two (2) submissions in Track 1 and no more than one (1) submission in Track 2. For the newly defined Track 3, no more than one (1) submission per competition is permitted.  As a result, it is now possible for an institution to submit up to four MRI proposals within the Track limits as described above.

Track 1: Track 1 MRI proposals are those that request funds from NSF greater than $100,000[1] and less than $1,400,000.
Track 2: Track 2 MRI proposals are those that request funds from NSF greater than or equal to $1,400,000 up to and including $4,000,000.
Track 3: Track 3 MRI proposals are those that request funds from NSF greater than or equal to $100,000[1] and less than or equal to $4,000,000 that include the purchase, installation, operation, and maintenance of equipment and instrumentation to conserve or reduce the consumption of helium. Institutions may submit no more than one Track 3 proposal. Submission of a Track 3 proposal does not impact limits that apply for Track 1 and Track 2 proposals.

Cost sharing requirements for new awards in the MRI Program are waived for a period of 5 years beginning with the FY 2023 MRI competition. Institutional submission limits for Track 1, Track 2 and Track 3 proposals remain.
The MRI Program especially seeks broad representation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines. Proposals from women, underrepresented minorities, persons with disabilities and early-career PIs are encouraged, as are proposals that benefit early-career researchers and proposals with PIs from geographically underserved regions, including EPSCoR jurisdictions. Additionally, proposals are encouraged from under-resourced institutions, including from emerging research institutions, where MRI can significantly build capacity for research.

"Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Directorate for STEM Education (IUSE: EDU)","Synopsis of Program:
The fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) hold much promise as sectors of the economy where we can expect to see continuous vigorous growth in the coming decades. STEM job creation is expected to outpace non-STEM job creation significantly, according to the Commerce Department, reflecting the importance of STEM knowledge to the US economy.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) plays a leadership role in developing and implementing efforts to enhance and improve STEM education in the United States. Through the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) initiative, the agency continues to make a substantial commitment to the highest caliber undergraduate STEM education through a Foundation-wide framework of investments. The IUSE: EDU is a core NSF STEM education program that seeks to promote novel, creative, and transformative approaches to generating and using new knowledge about STEM teaching and learning to improve STEM education for undergraduate students. The program is open to application from all institutions of higher education and associated organizations. NSF places high value on educating students to be leaders and innovators in emerging and rapidly changing STEM fields as well as educating a scientifically literate public. In pursuit of this goal, IUSE: EDU supports projects that seek to bring recent advances in STEM knowledge into undergraduate education, that adapt, improve, and incorporate evidence-based practices into STEM teaching and learning, and that lay the groundwork for institutional improvement in STEM education. In addition to innovative work at the frontier of STEM education, this program also encourages replication of research studies at different types of institutions and with different student bodies to produce deeper knowledge about the effectiveness and transferability of findings.
IUSE: EDU also seeks to support projects that have high potential for broader societal impacts, including improved diversity of students and instructors participating in STEM education, professional development for instructors to ensure adoption of new and effective pedagogical techniques that meet the changing needs of students, and projects that promote institutional partnerships for collaborative research and development. IUSE: EDU especially welcomes proposals that will pair well with the efforts of NSF INCLUDES (https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/nsfincludes/index.jsp) to develop STEM talent from all sectors and groups in our society.
For all the above objectives, the National Science Foundation invests primarily in evidence-based and knowledge-generating approaches to understand and improve STEM learning and learning environments, improve the diversity of STEM students and majors, and prepare STEM majors for the workforce. In addition to contributing to STEM education in the host institution(s), proposals should have the promise of adding more broadly to our understanding of effective teaching and learning practices.
The IUSE: EDU program features two tracks: (1) Engaged Student Learning and (2) Institutional and Community Transformation. ","standard, continuing","2025-07-16, 2025-07-16",,505082,nsf23510,Cleared,2022-10-19,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/iuse-edu-improving-undergraduate-stem-education-directorate-stem/nsf23-510,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/iuse-edu-improving-undergraduate-stem-education-directorate-stem/nsf23-510/solicitation

"Paleo Perspectives on Present and Projected Climate (P4CLIMATE)","Much can be learned about the climate system using existing historical observations and models of current climate, but those records and models do not reflect the range of climate behavior on multi-decadal to millennial time scales, or capture tipping points, thresholds, and other key features of the climate system. For that, data from geological records or other environmental archives are required.
The PALEO PERSPECTIVES ON PRESENT AND PROJECTED CLIMATE (P4CLIMATE) competition is a coordinated paleoclimate science initiative that is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Divisions of Atmospheric and GeoSpace Sciences (AGS), Earth Sciences (EAR), Ocean Sciences (OCE), and Office of Polar Programs (OPP) in the Geosciences (GEO) Directorate. The annual P4CLIMATE competition supports the scientific objectives of the National Science Foundation by fostering interdisciplinary research and synthesis of climate data.
The goal of the interdisciplinary P4CLIMATE solicitation is to utilize observational and modeling studies to provide paleo perspectives addressing the two research themes: 1) Past Regional and Seasonal Climate; and 2) Past Climate Forcing, Sensitivity, and Feedbacks. 
OPP will accept proposals to this solicitation A) with and without fieldwork in the Arctic, and B) only without fieldwork in the Antarctic.  Proposals that have fieldwork in Antarctica should be submitted to the annual solicitation for proposals that have fieldwork in Antarctica.","standard, continuing","2025-10-20, 2025-10-20",,506087,nsf22612,Cleared,2022-07-05,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/p4climate-paleo-perspectives-present-projected-climate/nsf22-612,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/p4climate-paleo-perspectives-present-projected-climate/nsf22-612/solicitation

"Mid-Career Advancement (MCA)","The MCA program offers an opportunity for scientists and engineers at the mid-career stage (see restrictions under Additional Eligibility Information) to substantively enhance and advance their research program and career trajectory. Mid-career scientists are at a critical career transition stage where they need to advance their research programs to ensure long-term productivity and creativity but are often constrained by service, teaching, or other activities that limit the amount of time devoted to research. MCA support is expected to help lift these constraints to reduce workload inequities and enable a more diverse scientific workforce (more women, persons with disabilities, and individuals from groups that have been underrepresented) at high academic ranks.
The MCA program provides protected time, resources, and the means to gain new skills through synergistic and mutually beneficial partnerships, typically at an institution other than the candidate's home institution. Partners from outside the Principal Investigator's (PI) own subdiscipline or discipline are encouraged, but not required, to enhance interdisciplinary networking and convergence across science and engineering fields. Research projects that envision new insights on existing problems or identify new problems made accessible with cutting-edge methodology or expertise from other fields are encouraged.
A key component of a successful MCA will be the demonstration that the PI's current research program could substantively benefit from the protected time, mentored partnership(s), and resources provided through this program, such that there is a substantial enhancement to the PI's research and career trajectory, enabling scientific and academic advancement not likely without this support. 
The MCA is the only cross-directorate NSF program specifically aimed at providing protected time and resources to established scientists and engineers targeted at the mid-career stage. Participating programs in the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO), Geosciences (GEO), Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), and Education and Human Resources (EHR) will accept MCA proposals. To help identify the disciplinary program in which the MCA should be reviewed, PIs are urged to investigate the research areas supported by the different directorates and participating programs. 
PIs are strongly encouraged to discuss the suitability of their MCA proposal with a Program Officer from the appropriate directorate (see https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/mca-mid-career-advancement/announcements/111199). PIs from EPSCoR jurisdictions are especially encouraged to apply.",standard,"2026-03-02, 2026-03-02",,505749,nsf22603,Cleared,2022-06-10,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/mca-mid-career-advancement/nsf22-603,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/mca-mid-career-advancement/nsf22-603/solicitation

"Mathematical Sciences Research Experiences for Undergraduates Sites (DMS REU Sites)","The NSF-wide REU Sites program is governed by a single solicitation but administered individually by each NSF Division or Directorate. An REU Site should provide research opportunities with a coherent intellectual theme and may be based in a single discipline or academic department or be interdisciplinary and multi-departmental.
The NSF-wide Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) solicitation governs the overall competition. The following clarifications/explanations are specifically for REU Site proposals submitted to the Division of Mathematical Sciences.

Three years is the typical project duration for DMS REU sites. Longer durations may be considered, but communication with the cognizant Program Officers (reu.dms@nsf.gov) prior to submission is encouraged.
DMS REU sites usually host between 8 and 12 students per year. If the planned site falls outside this range, communication with the cognizant Program Officers is encouraged prior to submission of the proposal.
Principal Investigators are reminded that the REU program solicitation requires specific information in the Project Description for an REU Site proposal, including detailed descriptions of examples of research projects that students will pursue. 
Proposal budgets for REU Site proposals to the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) should be formulated in accordance with the instructions in the NSF REU Program solicitation, with the following clarification: Well-justified requests for REU Sites with budgets exceeding the total-cost guideline in the REU solicitation will be considered.

The budget request for an REU Site proposal to DMS may include salary support for program management commensurate with the number of person-hours involved. Such expenses, in proposal budget Sections A and B, may include appropriate support for PI, co-PI(s), research mentors, or other student or program assistants. The proposal Budget Justification should include a breakdown of the program management activities and person-hours allocated to each. Budget requests will be reviewed for reasonability.
The bulk of the budget request for an REU Site proposal to DMS must consist primarily of Participant Support Costs for the undergraduate participants. However, proposal budgets are not strictly subject to the general expectation stated in the NSF REU program solicitation on maximum total REU Site project costs. Student stipends are expected to be no less than $700 per student per week. Other Participant Support Costs, including housing, meals, travel, and laboratory use fees, should reflect local conditions, and must be thoroughly justified.



Students may not apply to NSF to participate in REU activities; rather, students apply directly to REU Sites. Students interested in Mathematical Sciences REU should consult the Online Directory of DMS REU Sites for opportunities.
Interested PIs are also advised to explore the Online Directory of DMS REU Sites to determine the scope and breadth of fields supported.
NOTE: All DMS REU Site proposals must be submitted to the NSF-wide REU solicitation, with ""DMS - MPS/DMS - Research Experiences for Undergraduates"" (Directorate: Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences [MPS]; Division: Division of Mathematical Sciences [DMS]) selected as the appropriate Unit of Consideration.

"Leading Engineering for America's Prosperity, Health, and Infrastructure (LEAP HI)","The LEAP HI program challenges the engineering research community to take a leadership role in addressing demanding, urgent, and consequential challenges for advancing America’s prosperity, health and infrastructure.  LEAP HI proposals confront engineering problems that are too complex to yield to the efforts of a single investigator --- problems that require sustained and coordinated effort from interdisciplinary research teams, with goals that are not achievable through a series of smaller, short-term projects.  LEAP HI projects perform fundamental research that may lead to disruptive technologies and methods, lay the foundation for new and strengthened industries, enable notable improvements in quality of life, or reimagine and revitalize the built environment.

LEAP HI supports fundamental research projects involving collaborating investigators, of duration up to five years, with total budget between $1 million and $2 million.
LEAP HI proposals must articulate a fundamental research problem with compelling intellectual challenge and significant societal impact, particularly on economic competitiveness, quality of life, public health, or essential infrastructure.  One or more CMMI core topics must lie at the heart of the proposal, and integration of disciplinary expertise not typically engaged in CMMI-funded projects is encouraged.  
LEAP HI proposals must include an Engineering Leadership Plan that creatively communicates the excitement of engineering research to the general public, and particularly to future engineers, as the project unfolds. 
LEAP HI proposals must demonstrate the need for a sustained research effort by an integrated, interdisciplinary team and include a Research Integration Plan that provides a timeline for research activities and clearly explains how the project will be managed to ensure effective integration of project thrusts.

"Research Visioning for Computer and Information Science and Engineering : Future Research Directions for the CISE Community (CISE-RV)","Society's reliance on information, communication, computing and cyberinfrastructure in all aspects of daily life increases more and more each day. Innovations in these areas are now central to how we work, live, learn, communicate, shop, travel, socialize and conduct scientific research – a testament to the tremendous progress in computer and information science and engineering in the last 50 years fueled by strong research breakthroughs in all areas including artificial intelligence, hardware, networking, robotics, software, systems, and theory. The unprecedented growth and reach of information, communication, computing and cyberinfrastructure, and the constantly increasing demand for innovations and novel applications presents new fundamental and translational research challenges that need to be addressed. The information, communication, computing and cyberinfrastructure research community needs to stay ahead of the curve in this constantly evolving landscape.
The National Science Foundation’s Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) seeks to fund a community-driven organization that will identify ambitious new fundamental and translational research directions that align with national and societal priorities and thereby catalyze the computing research community's pursuit of innovative, high-impact research. Specifically, CISE calls on the information, communication, computing and cyberinfrastructure research community to establish a CISE Research Visioning activity (CISE-RV) to facilitate the articulation of compelling long-term research visions and establish multi-directional communication pathways for stakeholders with interest in information, communication, computing and cyberinfrastructure research, including those in academia, industry, government, professional societies, virtual organizations, international entities, and the general public. It is anticipated that through its activities the CISE-RV will strengthen connectivity and increase coordination across these diverse stakeholders and enable rapid and efficient community response to emerging opportunities and areas of national need.
The CISE-RV should have representation from academia, industry, professional societies, and other stakeholders in the CISE fields, and should be inclusive of all disciplines including computer science, computer engineering, information sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and related fields. Through its proposed activities, the CISE-RV should provide the information, communication, computing and cyberinfrastructure research community with a sustainable process for identifying future research challenges and enabling the CISE research community to speak with a unified voice.
NSF anticipates funding a single award for up to five years, with the funding for each year of the award in the range of $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 per year. The CISE-RV in the steady state phase is expected to have a four-year time frame. Proposers that need a startup phase to develop and setup the organizational structure, in addition to the four-year steady state phase, may request up to one year of additional support, thereby requesting up to five years of support. Proposers are encouraged to take into consideration, when developing their proposed budgets, the effort required to start up and maintain steady state, varying annual budget requests accordingly.",coop,,,506005,nsf22567,Cleared,2022-02-09,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cise-rv-research-visioning-computer-information-science-engineering/nsf22-567,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cise-rv-research-visioning-computer-information-science-engineering/nsf22-567/solicitation

"Research Coordination Networks: Fostering and Nurturing a Diverse Community of CI Professionals","The national research cyberinfrastructure (CI) ecosystem is a key catalyst for discovery and innovation across research domains and plays a critical role in ensuring US leadership in science and engineering, economic competitiveness, and national security, consistent with NSF’s mission. A diverse, skilled, capable, and productive workforce is required to effectively leverage and utilize current, emerging, and future CI capabilities – spanning researchers who use CI, developers of new CI capabilities, and professionals that deploy and operate NSF-supported CI. Developing and sustaining such a dynamic CI workforce presents challenges that are similar across science and engineering research and education fields, such as implementing effective institutional and on-the-job training and refreshing skills to keep up with evolving software, technologies, platforms, and application requirements [1]. The CI workforce also faces somewhat unique challenges due to lack of clear career pathways and disparity in position descriptions.
In this broader context, NSF envisions fostering and nurturing diverse communities of CI Professionals (CIP) across all areas of science and engineering research and education [2] by establishing a network of connected and coordinated hubs that recognize and connect CI Professionals, support communications, training, sharing of best practices, and mobility across projects and organizations.
To establish this network for all stakeholders of the CI workforce, NSF will support a set of Research Coordination Networks (RCN) to advance CI Professionals communities through transformative and/or new approaches for fostering, nurturing, expanding, and sustaining such communities. The RCN:CIP projects are intended to:

foster exchange and community development among CI Professionals;
share experience on sustaining and retaining CI Professionals;
raise the awareness and importance of CI Professionals in academia, and convey the information to academic leaders on their career development;
communicate opportunities for, and importance of, CI Professionals’ collaboration with research and engineering groups;
advance best practices for recruiting and developing CI expertise at all levels;
explore mutually beneficial partnerships across the different stakeholders in academia, government, non-profits, and industry; and
explore the establishment and sustainability of a network of hubs over the longer term, including governance and coordination among these hubs.

The RCN:CIP will engage CI Professionals from across the NSF research and education community and will also include representatives from university leadership (e.g., Vice Presidents for Research) and industry. The RCN must maintain a website for dissemination of RCN information, including opportunities for participation. The RCN may be regional, focused on specific research disciplines, or a combination. A key goal, and metric of success, of the RCN investments will be broadening participation. Broad inclusion of minorities and underrepresented communities will be particularly important. RCNs focused on these communities, and/or well-suited opportunities for such institutions to open career paths for such individuals, are encouraged. Geographic diversity is an important consideration and proposals led by institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions are encouraged. In addition, participation by key organizations and societies (such as ACM – Association for Computing Machinery, CASC - Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation, and CRA – Computing Research Association) will be important and is also encouraged.
NSF expects the RCN:CIP awardees to coordinate their efforts and activities, for instance through joint workshops and knowledge sharing, towards the goal of defining and establishing an interconnected network of hubs with a common set of high-level objectives and overall outcomes. RCN:CIP will be expected to implement a range of measures to demonstrate progress, efficacy, and improvements.
It is required that prospective PIs contact the RCN:CIP Program Officer(s) to ascertain if the focus and budget of their proposed RCN is appropriate for this solicitation.

"EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: Bridging EPSCoR Communities (RII-BEC)","The Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) is designed to fulfill the mandate of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to promote scientific progress nationwide. Jurisdictions are eligible to participate in the NSF EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Program based on their level of total NSF support over their most recent five years (see RII eligibility). Through this program, NSF facilitates the establishment of partnerships among academic institutions and organizations in governmental, non-profit, and commercial or industrial sectors that are designed to effect sustainable improvements in a jurisdiction's research infrastructure, Research and Development (R&D) capacity, and hence, its R&D competitiveness.
In response to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (H.R. 1319, sec. 7502), the National Science Foundation (NSF) established the EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: Bridging EPSCoR Communities (RII-BEC) initiative. The RII-BEC initiative seeks to enable institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions to set up bridge programs to facilitate the transitions of Affected Groups (e.g., women, underrepresented groups, research trainees, and graduate fellows) from one stage of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) training to the next, with particular focus on providing support for individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM and those transitioning from or to minority-serving institutions (MSIs) within EPSCoR jurisdictions.
The RII-BEC initiative will accept proposals that support those individuals most strongly affected by the pandemic at vulnerable career transition points (e.g., first two years of college, or preparation for entry into graduate programs and/or the STEM workforce) within EPSCoR jurisdictions. The RII-BEC initiative will provide up to $1,000,000 total per award for up to 5 years to support the strategic goal of reducing student attrition at these key junctures to improve future R&D competitiveness of EPSCoR jurisdictions. Proposals may include partnerships within and/or across two-year and four-year institutions (including community colleges). A key feature of projects will be a program strategy and plan for recruitment, mentoring, retention, and graduation of students (U.S. citizens, nationals, and permanent residents) in NSF-supported STEM fields, with specific efforts aimed at underrepresented groups in STEM.

"Designing Accountable Software Systems (DASS)","Society is becoming highly dependent on software applications, systems, and platforms, as functionality in all aspects of business, government, and everyday life is increasingly implemented through software. At the same time, there has been an increase in the laws and regulations whose implementation and effectiveness depend on software. Whereas organizations and individuals throughout our history have been expected to comply with laws and regulations, now software systems also must be accountable and comply with them. Software systems need to be designed with legal and regulatory compliance in mind, and should be adaptable to changing laws and regulations, which themselves evolve with changing citizen expectations and social norms.
The Designing Accountable Software Systems (DASS) program solicits foundational research aimed towards a deeper understanding and formalization of the bi-directional relationship between software systems and the complex social and legal contexts within which software systems must be designed and operate. The DASS program aims to bring researchers in computer and information science and engineering together with researchers in law and social, behavioral, and economic sciences to jointly develop rigorous and reproducible methodologies for understanding the drivers of social goals for software and for designing, implementing, and validating accountable software systems. DASS will support well-conceived collaborations between these two groups of researchers. The first group consists of researchers in software design, which, for the purposes of this solicitation, is broadly defined as formal methods, programming languages, software engineering, requirements engineering, and human-centered computing. The second group consists of researchers in law and the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, who study social systems and networks, culture, social norms and beliefs, rules, canons, precedents, legal code, and routine procedures that govern the conduct of people, organizations, and countries.
Proposals for this program must create general advances in both (1) understanding the social, behavioral, economic and/or legal context of accountable software design; and (2) improving the methodology for designing accountable software beyond specific use cases. Each proposal must have at least one Principal Investigator (PI) or co-PI with expertise in software design and at least one PI or co-PI with expertise in law or a social, behavioral, or economic science. All proposals must contain a detailed collaboration plan that leverages the complementary expertise of the PIs/co-PIs in the designated areas and describes the mechanisms for continuous bi-directional collaboration.

"ECosystem for Leading Innovation in Plasma Science and Engineering (ECLIPSE)","Plasma science is a transdisciplinary field of research where fundamental studies in many disciplines, including plasma physics, plasma chemistry, materials science, and space science, come together to advance knowledge for discovery and technological innovation.  The primary goal of the ECosystem for Leading Innovation in Plasma Science and Engineering (ECLIPSE) program is to identify and capitalize on opportunities for bringing fundamental plasma science investigations to bear on problems of societal and technological need within the scope of science and engineering supported by the participating NSF programs.
The ECLIPSE meta-program has been created to foster an inclusive community of scientists and engineers, an ecosystem spanning multiple NSF Directorates, in the pursuit of translational research at the interface of fundamental plasma science and technological innovation.  The ECLIPSE program builds on the long history of NSF leadership in supporting multi-disciplinary research in plasma science and engineering, and is intended to enhance organizational unity within NSF, and potentially with other funding agencies, in considering proposals and supporting projects that may otherwise struggle to find a natural home within the existing hierarchy of Directorates, Divisions, and programs within the Foundation.
Examples of topical areas within the scope of the ECLIPSE program include but are not limited to:

Plasma surface interactions, with applications to, e.g., advanced manufacturing, materials processing, and catalysis.
Atmospheric pressure plasmas and microplasmas with applications to, e.g., microelectronics, plasma agriculture, environmental remediation, and other clean and decarbonized energy goals enabled by electrification of the chemical industry.
Dusty plasmas with applications to, e.g., development of nanomaterials, aerosols, and functionalized surface coatings.
Novel sensor development for highly non-equilibrium plasmas with applications to, e.g., cubesat-based geospace measurements and industrial plasma diagnostics.
Novel computational modeling for multi-component and/or multi-phase plasma systems with applications to, e.g., space weather prediction and plasma reactor design.
Novel studies of plasmons in nano-photonics and nano-optics with applications to, e.g., sub-THz wireless communication and photocatalytic chemical processes.
New chemical measurement science for characterizing processes occurring in plasmas and using plasmas as part of measurement systems with applications to, e.g., analysis of environmental contaminants or identification of forensic evidence.
Study of fundamental chemical reactions and mechanisms in plasmas with applications to, e.g., novel chemical synthesis.

Proposals submitted for consideration by this program should address societal or technological needs within the scope of science and engineering supported by the National Science Foundation.  Proposals addressing technology development primarily supported by other US government funding agencies are not eligible for consideration and may be returned without review.  Proposers are strongly encouraged to contact the cognizant Program Officers if they are unsure of the suitability of a project to this program.
Proposals submitted for consideration by the ECLIPSE program should satisfy the following criteria:
(1) clearly articulate the fundamental scientific and/or engineering challenge in plasma science and engineering that may be relevant to more than one NSF program; and
(2) provide a substantive discussion of how a resolution of the stated scientific and/or engineering challenge will address specific societal and/or technological needs identified as priorities by the research communities, policymakers and/or other stakeholders. Depending on the nature of the proposal, the latter may be described as the Intellectual Merit or the Broader Impact of the proposed activity.  
The program encourages inclusion of specific efforts to increase the diversity of the ECLIPSE community and to broaden participation of under-represented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) as Broader Impacts of proposed work.  The program welcomes proposals from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and institutions in EPSCoR-eligible jurisdictions, along with collaborations between these institutions.  Proposers are also encouraged to address how the proposed efforts may enhance workforce development towards STEM careers associated with the field of plasma science and engineering.
The ECLIPSE program is not intended to replace existing programs.  A proposal that is requesting consideration within the context of ECLIPSE should begin the title with the identifying acronym ""ECLIPSE:"" and should be submitted to one of the ""Related Programs"" listed below. In choosing the most relevant program, proposers are advised to read program descriptions and solicitations carefully and to consult with cognizant Program Officers in advance of proposal preparation. Proposal submissions outside of the scientific scope of the receiving program may be transferred to a different program or may be returned without review. Proposers should ask for consideration and review as an ECLIPSE proposal only if the proposal addresses both of the criteria listed above.  Proposals marked for consideration by the ECLIPSE program that do not address both of these criteria may be returned without review or reviewed within the context of an individual program. Supplement requests to existing awards within a program that address both of the above criteria may also be considered.

"Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences Program - Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Awards (HEGS-DDRI)","The objective of the Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences Program is to support basic scientific research about the nature, causes and/or consequences of the spatial distribution of human activity and/or environmental processes across a range of scales. Contemporary geographical research is an arena in which diverse research traditions and methodologies are valid. Recognizing the breadth of the field's contributions to science, the HEGS Program welcomes proposals for empirically grounded, theoretically engaged, and methodologically sophisticated, generalizable research in all sub-fields of geographical and spatial sciences.
Because the National Science Foundation's mandate is to support basic scientific research, the NSF Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences program does not fund research that takes as its primary goal humanistic understanding or applied research. HEGS welcomes proposals that creatively integrate scientific and critical approaches, and that engage rigorous quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods in novel ways. However, a proposal that applies geographical/spatial methods to a social problem but does not propose how that problem provides an opportunity to make a theory-testing and/or theory expanding contributions to geographical science will be returned without review. HEGS supported projects are expected to yield results that will enhance, expand, and transform fundamental geographical theory and methods, and that will have positive broader impacts that benefit society. A proposal to the HEGS Program must also articulate how the results are generalizable beyond the case study. 
It should be noted that HEGS is situated in the Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences Division of the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate at NSF. Therefore, it is critical that research projects submitted to the Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences Program illustrate how the proposed research questions engage human dimensions relevant and important to people and societies.

"CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates Sites (CISE REU Sites)","The Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) participates in the NSF-wide Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. The Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS) manages the REU Site program for CISE. An REU Site should provide research opportunities with a coherent intellectual theme and may be based in a single discipline or academic department or be interdisciplinary and multi-departmental.
REU proposals submitted to CISE should have a CISE research focus. Proposals should have a strong computing or cyberinfrastructure aspect and involve CISE majors in the cohorts and CISE faculty researchers as mentors. Projects involving research areas central to other disciplines that use computing applications should be directed to the directorate most closely aligned with the discipline focus area. The NSF-wide REU solicitation governs the overall competition. The following clarifications/explanations are specifically for REU Site proposals submitted to CISE.

CISE expects proposal budgets to include no more than one month of salary for the PI and no more than one additional month of salary distributed across co-PIs and senior personnel.
CISE REU Sites must exclusively use the NSF Education & Training Application (ETAP) to manage student applications and collecting student demographic information.
Proposals should not include travel to PI meetings in their budget. PIs will have opportunities to request funding for travel as needed through separate venues.  
Proposals should not include travel for students to conferences in their budget. Students may apply for Travel Grants via the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory's REU Travel Grant Program.
CISE-funded REU Sites typically host between 8-10 students for a summer program lasting 8-10 weeks long.
Over the past several years, Site awards to institutions have the predominant costs under the Participant Support Costs (PSC); typically, PSC constitute 75% or more of the Total Direct Costs. Student stipends are expected to be approximately $700 per student per week. Housing, meal needs, and travel to and from the REU are expected to be addressed for all REU students. Housing and meal allowance are expected to be based on costs provided by housing office or other relevant party. Local students participating in the REU site should receive a housing stipend if they are not staying in the housing provided by the REU Site. 
CISE REU Sites are encouraged to participate in the program evaluation “Comparative Evaluation of Undergraduate Research Opportunities on Student Interest in Research Careers in CISE Fields” conducted by the Computing Research Association’s Center for Evaluating Research Pipeline to fulfill the evaluation requirement of the REU Sites program.  Submit an interest form to sign up and for a statement to include in your proposal. PIs who choose to participate in this evaluation do not have to include evaluation in their proposal budget.

Interested PIs are advised to explore the Online Directory of CISE REU Sites to determine the scope and breadth of fields funded by CISE under the REU Sites program.

"Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP)","The Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) provides awards to federally recognized1  Tribal Colleges and Universities, Alaska Native-serving institutions, and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions to promote high quality science (including sociology, psychology, anthropology, linguistics, economics and bioeconomics, statistics, and other social and behavioral sciences; natural sciences; computer science, including, but not limited to, artificial intelligence, quantum information science, and cybersecurity), technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), STEM education, research, and outreach. Support is available to TCUP-eligible institutions (see the Additional Eligibility subsection of Section IV of this solicitation) for transformative capacity-building or community engagement projects through Instructional Capacity Excellence in TCUP Institutions (ICE-TI), Targeted STEM Infusion Projects (TSIP),TCUP for Secondary and Elementary Teachers in STEM (TSETS), TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers), Cyberinfrastructure Health, Assistance, and Improvements (CHAI), and Preparing for TCUP Implementation (Pre-TI). Collaborations led by TCUP institutions that involve non-TCUP institutions of higher education are supported through TCUP Partnerships, with the participation of other NSF programs to support the work of non-TCUP institutions.  Finally, research studies that further the scholarly activity of individual faculty members are supported through Small Grants for Research (SGR). Through the opportunities highlighted above, as well as collaborations with other National Science Foundation (NSF) divisions and directorates, and other organizations, TCUP aims to increase Native individuals' participation in STEM careers, improve the quality of STEM programs at TCUP-eligible institutions, and facilitate the development of a strong STEM enterprise in TCUP institutions' service areas.


TCUP supports transformative capacity-building, community engagement, or research projects at TCUP-eligible institutions through the following funding tracks:
Instructional Capacity Excellence in TCUP Institutions (ICE-TI) projects provide support to design, implement, and assess comprehensive institutional improvements in STEM education and research capacity at TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education. By strengthening STEM education and STEM education research, successful projects will increase the number of STEM students and improve the quality of their preparation. ICE-TI projects create and/or adapt and assess innovative models and materials for teaching and learning in STEM, embody knowledge about how students learn most effectively in STEM teaching and learning activities, and bring STEM disciplinary advances into the undergraduate or graduate experience. The objective of this strand is to expand STEM degrees offered by TCUP-eligible institutions or significantly enhance instructional approaches.

Targeted STEM Infusion Projects (TSIP) support the attainment of a short-term, well-defined goal to improve the quality of STEM education at an eligible institution. Targeted STEM Infusion Projects could, for example, enhance academic infrastructure by systematically adding traditional knowledge to the scope or content of a STEM course, updating curricula, modernizing laboratory research equipment, developing and delivering professional development for K-12 STEM educators, or improving the computational infrastructure. The objective of this strand is to expand STEM degrees or significantly enhance instructional approaches.

TCUP for Secondary & Elementary Teachers in STEM (TSETS) supports in-service professional development in STEM disciplinary or STEM education content and/or research for K-12 STEM teachers in the relevant service area. Examples of project activities include, but are not limited to, professional development involving seminar series and engagement in STEM instruction and content during the academic year, structured series of summer intensive workshops and trainings, and summer research opportunities. The objective of this strand is to broaden the instructional capacity for STEM in the K-12 workforce and thereby to the entire community, and to build the capacity for STEM disciplinary or education research among participating educational professionals. 

TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers) coalesce the STEM and/or STEM education expertise into a team, designed to support and promote the STEM goals, needs, aspirations, or interests of the chartering reservation or tribe(s). TEA Centers may address a critical tribal or community need or focus on a realm of research or design that is beyond the scope of individual research grants or that is of interest to multiple tribes. The objective of this strand is to build on the capacity developed through prior TCUP support and apply expertise to collaborations with communities in the institutions service area, or nationally. 

The Cyberinfrastructure Health, Assistance, and Improvements (CHAI) strand supports projects at TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education to upgrade the cyberinfrastructure necessary to conduct, expand, manage and administer STEM programs of study, including research. The objective of this strand is to equip TCUP institutions to meet the demands of virtual instruction, advanced computing, and data science opportunities. 

Preparing for TCUP Implementation (Pre-TI) provides support for activities that prepare an institution for Implementation-level projects. Consequently, they are available only to TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education that have never received TCUP support, have not received TCUP support within the previous five years, or are embarking on a significantly novel STEM strategic plan. Examples of supported activities include completing an institutional assessment of its current STEM instructional capacity, or engaging in conversations necessary to formulate a shared vision of what that capacity should be and how to achieve it. Pre-TI awards can support staff and faculty release time, travel, stakeholder gatherings, and associated administrative costs. The objective of this strand is to conduct self-studies and formulate strategic plans for the development of STEM instructional programs of study. 

The TCUP Partnerships strand provides support for collaborations that will improve TCUP institutions' instructional and research capacity in STEM fields supported by NSF; attract, retain, and support TCUP students in internships and research endeavors deemed to be necessary for a complete curriculum offering; and engage partner universities to provide an academic grounding and a successful transition for students who wish to study or attain degrees in STEM fields supported by NSF. TCUP Partnerships broaden the number of scientific disciplines available to students at TCUP institution through collaborations with non-TCUP institutions.  Active Pre-Engineering Education Collaboratives or Partnerships in Geoscience Education awards are not affected by this revision. The objective of this strand is the development, through instructional and research capacity-building, of academic and career pathways for TCUP students through supporting collaborative projects between and among TCUP and non-TCUP institutions.  Interested teams of collaborators for which a TCUP institution serves as lead should contact the TCUP program directors.  Support for non-TCUP partners must be obtained from other NSF programs, which follows the procedures of the prior Partnership strands.

Small Grants for Research (SGR) strand support STEM or STEM Education faculty members at TCUP-eligible institutions to initiate or pursue research projects or programs that may include undergraduate or graduate student engagement. Awards are intended to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness; improve research and teaching at his or her home institution; create and study new models and innovations in STEM teaching and learning; and enhance the understanding of diverse groups' participation in STEM education practices and interventions. International research or collaborations are strongly encouraged. TCUP students may seek support for international research opportunities under the guidance of a TCUP STEM or STEM education faculty member and an international research collaborator. These awards are particularly appropriate as a means of recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientists, engineers, and educators at TCUP-eligible institutions. The objective of this strand is to support faculty research and professional development that build research capacity at TCUP institutions.

"GERMINATION: Germination of Research Questions for Addressing Critical Societal Challenges","Engineers and scientists are capable of making enormous impact when they conceive and conduct fundamental research that addresses societal needs. Our world faces many critical challenges engendered in part by the expanding and aging world population, including meeting global needs for food, energy, water, land, and other resources, while respecting and maintaining the balance of our planetary ecosystem. Other notable challenges include addressing climate change; maintaining cybersecurity, privacy, and fairness in our increasingly connected world; and providing, maintaining and protecting infrastructure. All of these represent potentially large and fertile opportunities for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) research to serve society. 
The NSF Directorate for Engineering GERMINATION program aims to foster the development of pedagogical frameworks, platforms and/or environments to enable participants to formulate research questions and ideas with potentially transformative outcomes. The extraordinary response of the STEM research community to the COVID-19 pandemic, exemplified by the record-breaking speed of novel vaccine development, highlights the outstanding capabilities at all levels of the research enterprise. The GERMINATION program seeks to harness the immense capacities of academic researchers to similarly address other critical global challenges through supporting the development of new pedagogical approaches that train researchers to formulate and develop key research questions. 
The GERMINATION program invites proposals to design, test, evaluate and implement pedagogical frameworks, platforms and/or environments that enable participants to formulate research questions and ideas that have the potential to address critical societal challenges. In order to catalyze development of novel approaches, while simultaneously expanding the reach of pilot approaches which are already exhibiting promise, two tracks will be supported in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022: GERMINATION Innovation and GERMINATION Expansion. GERMINATION Innovation awards will fund projects to design, test and evaluate previously unexplored pedagogical frameworks, platforms and/or environments that have the explicit goal of enabling the participants to formulate research questions with potentially transformative outcomes. Projects submitted to the Innovation track must use the EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) proposal type (see PAPPG Chapter II). GERMINATION Expansion awards will fund projects that focus on development, implementation and scaling of evidence-based strategies for achieving GERMINATION goals. Projects supported under the Expansion track should focus on scaling previously piloted approaches with demonstrated efficacy to a regional or national sphere of activity, and will likely involve development of new collaborative relationships to establish networks capable of implementation beyond the pilot institution.","standard, continuing",,,505912,nsf21594,"Current but no longer receiving proposals",2021-06-23,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/germination-germination-research-questions-addressing/nsf21-594,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/germination-germination-research-questions-addressing/nsf21-594/solicitation
"EDU Core Research (ECR:Core)","The EHR Core Research (ECR) program offers this ECR:Core solicitation and invites proposals for fundamental research (curiosity-driven basic research and use-inspired basic research) that contributes to the general, explanatory knowledge that underlies STEM education in one or more of the three broadly conceived Research Areas: Research on STEM Learning and Learning Environments, Research on Broadening Participation in STEM fields, and Research on STEM Workforce Development. Within this framework, the ECR program supports a wide range of fundamental STEM education research activities, aimed at learners of all groups and ages in formal and informal settings.
Fundamental research generates knowledge and understanding with the potential for broad relevance. The potential implications of ECR fundamental research for improving STEM education practice may be indirect and long-term rather than direct and immediate. Moreover, whether they include basic or use-inspired basic research, all successful ECR:Core proposals focus on the advancement or refinement of foundational knowledge for STEM education.

"Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP)","The NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program contributes to the National Science Foundation's objective to foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce.1  Through this solicitation, the NSF seeks to build on prior AGEP work, and other research and literature concerning racial and ethnic equity, in order to address the AGEP program goal to increase the number of historically underrepresented minority faculty in STEM.2  Furthering the AGEP goal requires advancing knowledge about new academic STEM career pathway models, and about evidence-based systemic or institutional change initiatives to promote equity and the professional advancement of the AGEP populations who are pursuing, entering and continuing in non-tenure and tenure-track STEM faculty positions. The use of the term ""historically underrepresented minority"" reflects language from Congress, and in the context of the AGEP program, the AGEP populations are defined as STEM doctoral candidates, postdoctoral scholars and faculty, who are African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The terms for these racial and ethnic populations are derived from the US government's guidance for federal statistics and administrative reporting.  At the graduate student level, only doctoral candidates are included because they have greater potential to enter a faculty position within the project duration time frame.
Improving equity and inclusion is critical to advancing STEM faculty, educating America’s future STEM workforce, fostering individual opportunity and contributing to a thriving U.S. economy. The NSF AGEP program, therefore, seeks to fund grants that advance and enhance the systemic factors that support equity and inclusion and, consequently, mitigate the systemic inequities in the academic profession and workplace.  The AGEP program goal to increase the number of historically underrepresented minority faculty is bolstered by the National Science Board’s Vision 2030: Vision for the Future.3
Systemic and organizational inequities may exist in areas such as policy and practice as well as in institutional, departmental, laboratory and classroom culture and climate. AGEP proposals may address, for example, practices in academic departments that result in the inequitable allocation of service or teaching assignments which may impede research productivity, delay career advancement, and create a culture of differential treatment and rewards. Similarly, policies and procedures that fail to mitigate implicit bias in hiring, tenure, and promotion decisions could lead to people who are members of AGEP populations being evaluated less favorably, perpetuating historical under-participation in STEM academic careers and contributing to an academic climate that is not inclusive.
All AGEP Alliances are expected to engage similar institutions of higher education (IHE) to work collaboratively and use intersectional approaches in the design, implementation, and evaluation of systemic change strategies. The collaborating IHEs must be similar to each other based on such variables as Carnegie classification, geographic location and student and/or faculty demographic characteristics.
This solicitation includes three funding tracks that all support the AGEP program goal.  All tracks require collaborative IHE teams to use an intersectional lens as they address systemic and institutional change strategies at IHEs to promote equity for AGEP populations.

The AGEP Institutional Transformation Alliance (ITA) track is designed to support the development, implementation, and evaluation of innovative systemic and institutional change strategies that promote equity for AGEP populations, within similar IHEs. ITAs will create permanent policy and practice changes that advance AGEP populations, and the project work is expected to be sustained after NSF funding expires. Please note that a preliminary proposal to the ITA track is required, and that at least one of the institutions submitting must first have or have had an AGEP Catalyst Alliance.  The proposing IHEs represented in the preliminary ITA proposal must be the same collaborating IHEs who will plan to submit a full ITA proposal, if invited by NSF to submit the full ITA. Please read the full solicitation for details about ITA Preliminary and Full proposal submissions that begin in FY2022.
The AGEP Faculty Career Pathways Alliance Model (FC-PAM) track is intended to support the development, implementation, evaluation, and institutionalization of Alliance models that will advance AGEP populations, within similar IHEs. The FC-PAM collaborators must also self-study into how socio-cultural, economic, structural, leadership and institutional variables affect the formation of the FC-PAM Alliance, and the strategies or interventions the collaborators implement to advance the AGEP populations. A Letter of Intent (LOI) is required ONLY for IHEs that plan to submit an FC-PAM collaborative proposal, and only one LOI is needed for the collaborating research institutions that plan to submit the FC-PAM proposal.The FC-PAM track will only be available in FY2021-FY2022 and it will be discontinued thereafter.
The AGEP Catalyst Alliance (ACA) track supports the design and implementation of one or more organizational self-assessment(s) to collect and analyze data that will identify inequities affecting the AGEP populations; pilot equity strategies as appropriate; and develop a five-year equity strategic plan for the AGEP populations. The ACA is meant as a facilitator grant to help similar IHEs generate the foundational work necessary to initiate an ITA project.

NSF, through the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC), has published a vision that calls for the broad availability and innovative use of an agile, integrated, robust, trustworthy and sustainable CI ecosystem that can drive new thinking and transformative discoveries in all areas of S&E research and education. In support of this vision, NSF is releasing two solicitations in parallel: this solicitation, Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support  Coordination Office (ACCESS-ACO), and Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support (ACCESS). This solicitation focuses on the creation of a coordination office to support the collective and coordinated operation of the NSF ACCESS solicitation awardees. The ACCESS solicitation aims to establish a suite of CI coordination servicesmeant to support a broad and diverse set of requirements, users, and usage modes from all areas of S&E research and educationand calls for proposals for five independently-managed yet tightly-cooperative service tracks (see Figure 1).
 

Figure 1: Network of ACCESS services, with a focus on the ACO Services.
 
This solicitation expects to fund one award for an ACCESS Coordination Office (ACO) to support the collective and coordinated operation of the five CI coordination services. Specifically, the ACO will provide coordination and support services and staffing for top-level coordination and communications among the ACCESS awardees and with the public, including support for top-level inter-awardee governance, coordination of an external advisory board to the ACCESS awardees, maintenance of the top-level landing page of the ACCESS website, and coordinated community-building activities. The ACO awardee will interface with the awardees for the ACCESS service tracks of the ACCESS solicitation. The ACO itself will not engage in overall governance or management responsibilities for the ACCESS but awardees will enable the other ACCESS awardees to accomplish those activities through provision of staffing and services.",coop,,,505867,nsf21556,Cleared,2021-01-25,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/access-aco-advanced-cyberinfrastructure-coordination-ecosystem-services/nsf21-556,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/access-aco-advanced-cyberinfrastructure-coordination-ecosystem-services/nsf21-556/solicitation
"Innovation Corps Teams Program","The National Science Foundation (NSF) seeks to further develop and nurture a national innovation ecosystem that guides the output of scientific discoveries closer to the development of technologies, products, and services that benefit society. The goals of the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Program, created in 2011 by NSF, are to spur translation of fundamental research to the marketplace, to encourage collaboration between academia and industry, and to train NSF-funded faculty, students and other researchers in innovation and entrepreneurship skills.
The I-Corps Program utilizes experiential learning of customer and industry discovery, coupled with first-hand investigation of industrial processes, to quickly assess the translational potential of inventions.  The I-Corps Program is designed to support the commercialization of ""deep technologies,”  those revolving around fundamental discoveries in science and engineering. The I-Corps Program addresses the skill and knowledge gaps associated with the transformation of basic research into deep technology ventures (DTVs).
The purpose of the I-Corps Teams program is to identify NSF-funded researchers to receive additional support in the form of entrepreneurial education, mentoring, and funding to accelerate the translation of knowledge derived from fundamental research into emerging products and services that may attract subsequent third-party funding. The outcomes of I-Corps Teams' projects are threefold: 1) a decision on a clear path forward based on an assessment of the business model, 2) substantial first-hand evidence for or against product-market fit, with the identification of customer segments and corresponding value propositions, and 3) a narrative of a technology demonstration for potential partners.

"Integrative Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems (NCS)","The complexities of brain and behavior pose fundamental questions in many areas of science and engineering, drawing intense interest across a broad spectrum of disciplinary perspectives while eluding explanation by any one of them. Rapid advances within and across disciplines are leading to an increasingly interwoven fabric of theories, models, empirical methods and findings, and educational approaches, opening new opportunities to understand complex aspects of neural and cognitive systems through integrative multidisciplinary approaches.
This program calls for innovative, convergent, boundary-crossing proposals that can best capture those opportunities and map out new research frontiers. NSF seeks proposals that pursue high-value scientific and technical risks by transcending the perspectives and approaches typical of disciplinary research efforts. This cross-directorate program is one element of NSF’s participation in the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative (http://www.nsf.gov/brain/). NSF envisions a connected portfolio of transformative, integrative projects that create synergistic links across investigators and communities, yielding novel ways of tackling the challenges of understanding the brain in action and in context.
This solicitation extends the NCS program for three years, from FY2021 through FY2023, including biennial competitions for the FRONTIERS proposal class.
The program focuses on four aspects of neural and cognitive systems that are current targets of converging interdisciplinary interests. NCS projects must advance the foundations of one or more of these focus areas, as described further within the solicitation:

Neuroengineering and Brain-Inspired Concepts and Designs
Individuality and Variation
Cognitive and Neural Processes in Realistic, Complex Environments
Data-Intensive Neuroscience and Cognitive Science

Proposals must address both risk and reward: high-risk, high-payoff approaches are expected. Proposals must also go beyond the scope of any NSF core program, or they will not be considered responsive to this solicitation.
NCS will consider two classes of proposals. FOUNDATIONS awards will support high-risk, high-payoff projects that advance the foundations of one or more NCS focus areas. FRONTIERS awards (FY2021 and FY2023 competitions only) will support ambitious, highly integrative, interdisciplinary projects that advance and connect multiple integrative research threads to tackle challenges that would be intractable without a high level of collaboration and coordination.
Community-driven efforts such as workshops or synthesis papers are also encouraged, to map out new frontiers at the interface of neuroscience and other disciplines that could reshape brain research and its applications.","standard, continuing",,,505132,nsf21517,Cleared,2020-10-22,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ncs-integrative-strategies-understanding-neural-cognitive/nsf21-517,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ncs-integrative-strategies-understanding-neural-cognitive/nsf21-517/solicitation
"Law & Science (LS)","The Law & Science Program considers proposals that address social scientific studies of law and law-like systems of rules, as well as studies of how science and technology are applied in legal contexts. The Program is inherently interdisciplinary and multi-methodological. Successful proposals describe research that advances scientific theory and understanding of the connections between human behavior and law, legal institutions, or legal processes; or the interactions of law and basic sciences, including biology, computer and information sciences, STEM education, engineering, geosciences, and math and physical sciences. Scientific studies of law often approach law as dynamic, interacting with multiple arenas, and with the participation of multiple actors. Fields of study include many disciplines, and often address problems including, though not limited, to:

Crime, Violence, and Policing
Cyberspace

"Transitions to Excellence in Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Research (Transitions)","The Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) has developed a new opportunity to enable researchers with a strong track record of prior accomplishment to pursue a new avenue of research or inquiry.  This funding mechanism is designed to facilitate and promote a PI’s ability to effectively adopt empowering technologies that might not be readily accessible in the PI’s current research environment or collaboration network.  Transformative research likely spans disciplines and minimizing the practical barriers to doing so will strengthen research programs poised to make significant contributions. The award is intended to allow mid-career or later-stage researchers (Associate or Full Professor, or equivalent) to expand or make a transition in their research programs via a sabbatical leave or similar mechanism of professional development and then develop that research program in their own lab. This award will also enable the PI to acquire new scientific or technical expertise, facilitate the investigator’s competitiveness, and potentially lead to transformational impacts in molecular and cellular bioscience.  The award would fund up to six months of PI salary during the first sabbatical or professional development year, followed by support for continued research for two subsequent years upon the PI’s return to normal academic duties.  Requests for flexibility in the timing of the sabbatical or professional development year will be considered with appropriate justification. Please contact the cognizant program director for the solicitation. Through this solicitation MCB and NSF hope to develop a novel mechanism that will encourage investigators to expand and/or transition to new research areas aligned with MCB priorities, to increase retention of investigators in science, and to ensure a diverse scientific workforce that remains engaged in active research.
Highest funding priority is given to proposals that have outstanding intellectual merit and broader impacts, while proposals with weaknesses in either category (or those that are perceived as likely to have an incremental impact) will not be competitive.  Proposals should also demonstrate a strong record of prior accomplishment, a compelling plan for professional development that will enable the PI to forge a new direction in their scholarship, and a strong rationale for why this support is needed for the PI to become competitive in the new research area.  Support for the proposed transition from the PI’s department, described in a letter from the department chair or equivalent, will also be required.   Proposals that do not describe a plan for a transition in research direction will be considered unresponsive.  Proposals that are motivated to understand the molecular and cellular basis of disease and disease treatments are not appropriate for the Division and will be returned without review.
Proposals addressing major open questions at the intersections of biology with other disciplines, such as physics, chemistry, mathematics, computer sciences, and engineering are of particular interest to the program.","standard, continuing",,1,505821,nsf21508,Cleared,2020-10-06,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/transitions-transitions-excellence-molecular-cellular-biosciences/nsf21-508,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/transitions-transitions-excellence-molecular-cellular-biosciences/nsf21-508/solicitation

"Re-entry to Active Research Program (RARE)","The Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) and the Division of Chemistry (CHE) are conducting a Re-entry to Active Research (RARE) program to reengage, retrain, and broaden participation within the academic workforce. The primary objective of the RARE program is to catalyze the advancement along the academic tenure-track of highly meritorious individuals who are returning from a hiatus from active research. By providing re-entry points to active academic research, the RARE program will reinvest in the nation’s most highly trained scientists and engineers, while broadening participation and increasing diversity of experience. A RARE research proposal must describe potentially transformative research that falls within the scope of participating CBET or CHE programs.
The RARE program includes two Tracks to catalyze the advancement of investigators along the academic tenure system after a research hiatus, either to a tenure-track position or to a higher-tenured academic rank. Track 1 of the RARE program reengages investigators in a competitive funding opportunity with accommodations for gap in record that are a result of the research hiatus. A Track 1 proposal will follow the budgetary guidelines of the relevant CBET program for an unsolicited research proposal or the relevant CHE Disciplinary Research program. Track 2 retrains investigators for whom the research hiatus has led to the need for new or updated techniques, such that retraining is required to return the investigator to competitive research activity. A description of how these new techniques will lead to competitive research in CBET or CHE programs is required.  A Track 2 proposal budget will include only funds necessary for specific retraining activities, such as travel to a workshop or conference, workshop registration fees, a retraining sabbatical, or seed funding to support collection of preliminary data (including salary support, equipment usage fees, materials, and/or supplies).

"Plant Biotic Interactions","The Plant Biotic Interactions (PBI) program supports research on the processes that mediate beneficial and antagonistic interactions between plants and their viral, bacterial, oomycete, fungal, plant, and invertebrate symbionts, pathogens and pests. This joint NSF/NIFA program supports projects focused on current and emerging model and non-model systems, and agriculturally relevant plants. The program’s scope extends from fundamental mechanisms to translational efforts, with the latter seeking to put into agricultural practice insights gained from basic research on the mechanisms that govern plant biotic interactions. Projects must be strongly justified in terms of fundamental biological processes and/or relevance to agriculture and may be purely fundamental or applied or include aspects of both perspectives. All types of symbiosis are appropriate, including commensalism, mutualism, parasitism, and host-pathogen interactions. Research may focus on the biology of the plant host, its pathogens, pests or symbionts, interactions among these, or on the function of plant-associated microbiomes. The program welcomes proposals on the dynamics of initiation, transmission, maintenance and outcome of these complex associations, including studies of metabolic interactions, immune recognition and signaling, host-symbiont regulation, reciprocal responses among interacting species and mechanisms associated with self/non-self recognition such as those in pollen-pistil interactions.

"Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers Program (IUCRC)","Program Mission:
The IUCRC program catalyzes breakthrough pre-competitive research by enabling close and sustained engagement between industry innovators, world-class academic teams, and government agencies.  IUCRCs help industry partners and government agencies connect directly and efficiently with university researchers to achieve three primary objectives: 1) Conduct high-impact research to meet shared and critical industrial needs in companies of all  sizes; 2) Enhance U.S. global leadership in driving innovative technology development, and 3)  Identify, mentor and develop a diverse, highly skilled science and engineering workforce.
Program Overview:
The IUCRC program provides a structure for academic researchers to conduct fundamental, pre-competitive research of shared interest to industry and government organizations. These organizations pay membership fees to a consortium so that they can collectively envision and fund research, with at least 90% of Member funds allocated to the direct costs of these shared research projects.
IUCRCs are formed around research areas of strategic interest to U.S. industry. Industry is defined very broadly to include companies (large and small), startups and non-profit organizations. Principal Investigators form a Center around emerging research topics of current research interest, in a pre-competitive space but with clear pathways to applied research and commercial development. Industry partners join at inception, as an existing Center grows or they inspire the creation of a new Center by recruiting university partners to leverage NSF support. Government agencies participate in IUCRCs as Members or by partnering directly with NSF at the strategic level.  
Universities, academic researchers, and students benefit from IUCRC participation through the research funding, the establishment and growth of industry partnerships, and educational and career placement opportunities for students. Industry Members benefit by accessing knowledge, facilities, equipment, and intellectual property in a highly cost-efficient model; leveraging Center research outcomes in their future proprietary projects; interacting in an informal, collaborative way with other private sector and government entities with shared interests; and identifying and recruiting talent.  NSF provides funding to support Center administrative costs and a governance framework to manage membership, operations, and evaluation.
Successful IUCRCs require:

A capable research/management team with an entrepreneurial mindset;
Universities, faculty, and students interested in engaging in research of interest to industry;
A community of industry partners seeking pre-competitive, use-inspired research projects.

Each IUCRC is expected to grow and become independently sustainable by the end of the NSF support. ","standard, continuing",,,505789,nsf20570,"Waiting for new publication",2020-05-04,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/iucrc-industry-university-cooperative-research-centers-program/nsf20-570,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/iucrc-industry-university-cooperative-research-centers-program/nsf20-570/solicitation

"PFE: Research Initiation in Engineering Formation (PFE: RIEF)","The PFE: Research Initiation in Engineering Formation (PFE: RIEF) program has two goals: 1) Support research in the Professional Formation of Engineers (PFE), and 2) Increase the community of researchers conducting PFE research. PIs are expected to have little or no experience conducting social science or education research. PFE: RIEF is not intended for established researchers in engineering education or other social science fields to initiate new projects. Those researchers should consider the Research in the Formation of Engineers program (https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505681).
 
The NSF Engineering (ENG) Directorate has launched a multi-year initiative, the Professional Formation of Engineers, to create and support an innovative and inclusive engineering profession for the 21st Century. Professional Formation of Engineers (PFE) refers to the formal and informal education and value systems by which people become engineers. It also includes the ethical responsibility of practicing engineers to sustain and grow the profession. The engineering profession must be responsive to national priorities, grand challenges, and dynamic workforce needs; it must be equally open and accessible to all.
 
Engineering faculty possess both deep technical expertise in their engineering discipline and the primary responsibility for the process of professional formation of future engineers. As such, engineering faculty are in a unique position to help address critical challenges in engineering formation. The Professional Formation of Engineers: Research Initiation in Engineering Formation (PFE: RIEF) program enables engineering faculty who are renowned for teaching, mentoring, or leading educational reform efforts on their campus to develop expertise in conducting engineering education research.","standard, continuing",,,503603,nsf20558,Cleared,2020-03-13,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pfe-rief-pfe-research-initiation-engineering-formation/nsf20-558,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pfe-rief-pfe-research-initiation-engineering-formation/nsf20-558/solicitation

"Expeditions in Computing (Expeditions)","The far-reaching impact and rate of innovation in the computer and information science and engineering ﬁelds has been remarkable, generating economic prosperity and enhancing the quality of life for people throughout the world.
More than a decade ago, the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) established the Expeditions in Computing (Expeditions) program to build on past successes and provide the CISE research and education community with the opportunity to pursue ambitious, fundamental research agendas that promise to deﬁne the future of computing and information.
In planning Expeditions projects, investigators are strongly encouraged to come together within or across departments or institutions to combine their creative talents in the identiﬁcation of compelling, transformative research agendas that look ahead by at least a decade and promise disruptive innovations in computer and information science and engineering for many years to come.
Now funded at levels up to $15,000,000 for seven years, Expeditions projects represent some of the largest single investments currently made by the CISE directorate. Together with the Science and Technology Centers and the National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes that CISE supports, Expeditions projects form the centerpiece of the directorate's center-scale award portfolio. With awards funded at levels that promote the formation of large research teams, CISE recognizes that concurrent research advances in multiple ﬁelds or sub-ﬁelds are often necessary to stimulate deep and enduring outcomes. The awards made in this program will complement research areas supported by other CISE programs, which target particular computer and information science and engineering ﬁelds.
Additionally, CISE offers Innovation Transition (InTrans) awards for teams nearing the end of their Expeditions as well as Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Frontier projects. The goal of InTrans is to continue the long-term vision and objectives of CISE’s center-scale projects. Through InTrans awards, CISE will provide limited funds to match industry support.

"Foundational Research in Robotics (FRR)","The Foundational Research in Robotics (FRR) program, jointly led by the CISE and ENG Directorates, supports research on robotic systems that exhibit significant levels of both computational capability and physical complexity. For the purposes of this program, a robot is defined as intelligence embodied in an engineered construct, with the ability to process information, sense, plan, and move within or substantially alter its working environment. Here intelligence includes a broad class of methods that enable a robot to solve problems or to make contextually appropriate decisions and act upon them. The program welcomes research that considers inextricably interwoven questions of intelligence, computation, and embodiment. Projects may also focus on a distinct aspect of intelligence, computation, or embodiment, as long as the proposed research is clearly justified in the context of a class of robots.
The focus of the FRR program is on foundational advances in robotics. Robotics is a deeply interdisciplinary field, and proposals are encouraged across the full range of fundamental engineering and computer science research challenges arising in robotics. To be responsive to the FRR program, each proposal should clearly articulate the following three points:

The focus of the research project should be a robot or a class of robots, as defined above. [Is there a robot?]
The goal of the project should be to endow a robot or a class of robots with new and useful capabilities or to significantly enhance existing capabilities. [Will a robot gain a new or significantly improved capability?]
The intellectual contribution of the proposed work should address fundamental gaps in robotics. [Is robotics essential to the intellectual merit of the proposal?]

Meaningful experimental validation on a physical platform is encouraged.
Projects that do not represent a direct fundamental contribution to the science of robotics or are better aligned with other existing programs at NSF should not be submitted to the FRR program.
Potential investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their projects with an FRR Program Officer before submission.

"Science of Science: Discovery, Communication and Impact (SoS:DCI)","The Science of Science: Discovery, Communication and Impact (SoS:DCI) program is designed to advance theory and knowledge about increasing the public value of scientific activity. Science of Science draws from multiple disciplinary and field perspectives to advance theory and research about scientific discovery, communication and impact. SoS:DCI welcomes proposals applying rigorous empirical research methods to advance theory and knowledge on:

The social and structural mechanisms of scientific discovery.
Theories, frameworks, models and data that improve our understanding of scientific communication and outcomes.
The societal benefits of scientific activity and how science advances evidence-based policy making and the creation of public value.

The SoS:DCI program, which expands upon the former Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) program, funds research that builds theoretical and empirical understanding of the social science of science. SoS:DCI welcomes proposals to conduct research at the individual, organizational and institutional levels or from micro, meso and macro scales and complex system levels. SoS:DCI encourages multiple disciplinary perspectives, interdisciplinary research and diverse methodological approaches in the pursuit of new knowledge to advance the science of science and evidence-based policy making. With these goals in mind, proposals should:

Draw from and advance theory, knowledge and frameworks on the science of science.
Develop models, data, indicators and associated analytical tools that constitute and enable transformative advances rather than incremental change. 
Provide credible rigorous assessments of the proposed project’s impact and social and policy implications.
Include robust data management plans with the goal of advancing open science and increasing public access to usable, valid and reliable scientific materials.

Of particular interest are proposals with the potential to strengthen America’s global leadership in science and increase national competitiveness across a broad range of domains. These include proposals that analyze strategies for strengthening and diversifying the scientific workforce, as well as ways to cultivate high-impact discovery across sectors. The program strongly encourages convergent research and collaboration.
In addition to intellectual merit, the program strongly encourages potential PIs to carefully consider the broader impacts of their work. The broader impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired policy outcomes. The Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate has released additional guidance on broader impacts for SBE proposals. 
The SoS:DCI program places a high priority on broadening participation in the sciences. It encourages participation from junior faculty, women and members of historically underrepresented groups, as well as proposals from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), Research Undergraduate Institutions (RUIs) and institutions in EPSCoR states.

"Science of Learning and Augmented Intelligence","Science of Learning and Augmented Intelligence (SL) supports potentially transformative research that develops basic theoretical insights and fundamental knowledge about principles, processes and mechanisms of learning, and about augmented intelligence — how human cognitive function can be augmented through interactions with others or with technology, or through variations in context. 
The program supports research addressing learning in individuals and in groups, across a wide range of domains at one or more levels of analysis, including molecular and cellular mechanisms; brain systems; cognitive, affective and behavioral processes; and social and cultural influences. 
The program also supports research on augmented intelligence that clearly articulates principled ways in which human approaches to learning and related processes, such as in design, complex decision-making and problem-solving, can be improved through interactions with others or through the use of artificial intelligence in technology. These could include ways of using knowledge about human functioning to improve the design of collaborative technologies that have the capacity to learn to adapt to humans.
For both aspects of the program, there is special interest in collaborative and collective models of learning and intelligence that are supported by the unprecedented speed and scale of technological connectivity. This includes emphasis on how people and technology working together in new ways and at scale can achieve more than either can attain alone. The program also seeks explanations for how the emergent intelligence of groups, organizations and networks intersects with processes of learning, behavior and cognition in individuals.   
Projects that are convergent or interdisciplinary may be especially valuable in advancing basic understanding of these areas, but research within a single discipline or methodology is also appropriate. Connections between proposed research and specific technological, educational and workforce applications will be considered as valuable broader impacts but are not necessarily central to the intellectual merit of proposed research. The program supports a variety of approaches, including experiments, field studies, surveys, computational modeling, and artificial intelligence or machine learning methods.
Examples of general research questions within scope of Science of Learning and Augmented Intelligence (SL) include:

What are the underlying mechanisms that support transfer of learning from one context to another or from one domain to another? How is learning generalized from a small set of specific experiences? What is the basis for robust learning that is resilient against potential interference from new experiences? How is learning consolidated and reconsolidated from transient experience to stable memory?
How do human interactions with technologies, imbued with artificial intelligence, provide improved human task performance? What models best describe the interplay of the individual and collaborative processes that lead to co-creation of knowledge and collective intelligence? In what ways do the capacities and constraints of human cognition inform improved methods of human-artificial intelligence collaboration? 
How can we integrate research findings and insights across levels of analysis, relating understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of learning in the neurons, to circuit and systems-level computations of learning in the brain, to cognitive, affective, social and behavioral processes of learning? What is the relationship between assembly of new networks (development) and learning new knowledge in a maturing or mature brain? What concepts, tools (including Big Data, machine learning, and other computational models) or questions will provide the most productive linkages across levels of analysis?
How can insights from biological learners contribute and derive new theoretical perspectives to artificial intelligence, neuromorphic engineering, materials science and nanotechnology? How can the ability of biological systems to learn from relatively few examples improve efficiency of artificial systems? How do learning systems (biological and artificial) address complex issues of causal reasoning? How can knowledge about the ways in which humans learn help in the design of human-machine interfaces?",standard,"2025-08-06, 2025-08-06",,505731,pd19127Y,Cleared,2019-09-18,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/science-learning-augmented-intelligence/pd19-127y,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/policies/pappg

"Environmental Engineering","The Environmental Engineering program is part of the Environmental Engineering and Sustainability cluster, which also includes 1) the Nanoscale Interactions program; and 2) the Environmental Sustainability program.
Environmental engineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies chemical, biological, and physical scientific principles to protect human and ecological health.
The goal of the Environmental Engineering program is to support potentially transformative fundamental research that applies scientific and engineering principles to 1) prevent, minimize, or re-use solid, liquid, and gaseous discharges of pollution to soil, water, and air by closing resource loops or through other measures; 2) mitigate the ecological and human-health impacts of such releases by smart/adaptive/reactive amendments or manipulation of the environment, and 3) remediate polluted environments through engineered chemical, biological, and/or geo-physical processes.
Integral to achieving these goals is a fundamental understanding of the transport and biogeochemical reactivity of pollutants in the environment. Therefore, research on environmental micro/biology, environmental chemistry, and environmental geophysics may be relevant providing the research has a clear objective of protecting human and ecological health.
Major areas of interest include (but are not limited to):  

Building a future without pollution or waste: Investigation of innovative biogeochemical processes that prevent or minimize the production of waste; waste valorization and other research that will lead to new technologies to extract resources from waste streams to close the resource loop.
Sustainable supply and protection of water: Investigation of innovative biogeochemical processes that remove, biologically or chemically transform, and/or prevent the release of contaminants in surface and groundwater; innovative processes for recovery of water, nutrients, and other resources from wastewater, saline water, or brines; innovative approaches to smart and adaptive management of surface water, groundwater, and urban watersheds and storm water to maintain/improve quality and prevent downstream impacts from nutrients and other water constituents. 
Environmental chemistry, fate, and transport of nutrients and contaminants of emerging concern in air, water, soils, and sediments: Investigation of transport and biogeochemical reactivity in the environment; environmental forensics to identify sources and reaction pathways; field- and laboratory scale experimental research that bridges gaps between data and predictions from molecular, continuum, and field-scale modeling.
Environmental engineering of the built environment: Research to understand the biogeochemical reactivity of the built environment with the goal of enhancing and improving human and ecological health; research that will lead to new technologies to improve outdoor and indoor air quality; research to understand how drinking water and wastewater chemical characteristics and microbial community structure impact or are affected by water quality and human health.

"OAC: OAC Core Research (OAC Core)","Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Core Research Program (OAC Core)
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) supports translational research and education activities in all aspects of advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) that lead to deployable, scalable, and sustainable systems capable of transforming science and engineering research and education. Advanced CI includes the spectrum of computational, data, software, networking, and security resources, tools, and services, along with the computational and data skills and expertise, that individually and collectively enable the conduct of science and engineering research and education. As part of its portfolio of investments, OAC supports research on advanced CI to address new CI frontiers for discovery leading to major innovations, and also supports development and deployment processes as well as expert services necessary for realizing the research CI that is critical to the advancement of science and engineering research and education.
This program aims to address the CI research challenges that significantly impact the future capabilities of advanced research CI by engaging a diverse community of computer and computational science and engineering researchers, scientists, faculty, and students. The context is emerging translational research challenges as highlighted by various recent reports. For example, the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) states, “High-performance computing (HPC) is essential to the Nation’s global economic competitiveness, scientific discovery, and security.” Likewise, the Federal Big Data Research and Development Strategic Plan states,  “A national Big Data innovation ecosystem is essential to enabling knowledge discovery from and confident action informed by the vast resource of new and diverse datasets that are rapidly becoming available in nearly every aspect of life.” The 2017 National Academies’ report on Future Directions for NSF Advanced Computing Infrastructure to Support U.S. Science and Engineering in 2017-2020 recognizes that “large-scale simulation and the accumulation and analysis of massive amounts of data are revolutionizing many areas  of science and engineering research.” And the 2019 NSF document entitled Transforming Science Through Cyberinfrastructure: NSF’s Blueprint for a National Cyberinfrastructure Ecosystem for Science and Engineering in the 21st Century aims to “recognize and support the translational research continuum, from (i) catalyzing core cyberinfrastructure innovations essential to address disruptive changes in applications and technologies, through (ii) fostering the development of community tools and frameworks, to (iii) enabling the deployment and operation of sustainable production-quality cyberinfrastructure services.”
The OAC Core Research program seeks innovative proposals for translational research on the design, development, deployment, experimentation, and application of advanced research CI. OAC Core Research investments are further characterized by one or more of the following key attributes:

Multi-disciplinary: leveraging techniques from multiple disciplines and may require collaboration among investigators from relevant disciplines/sub-disciplines (e.g., computer science and physics; operating systems and computer architecture, etc.);


Extreme-scale: exploring pathways to leading-edge, leadership-scale research CI, from architecture to algorithms to models;


Driven by science and engineering research: exploring scalable models, algorithms, techniques, and tools needed for fundamentally new science and engineering advances;


An end-to-end solution: pursuing novel integrated systems that support complete research workflows; and


Deployable as robust research CI: exploring seamless pathways for integration into robust CI systems or operational scientific and engineering research applications.

This research program seeks to broaden participation by a wide range of science and engineering disciplines and institutions, and by harnessing the capabilities of larger segments of diverse underrepresented groups. Proposals from, and in partnership with, the aforementioned communities are especially encouraged. For a multi-disciplinary project requiring CI as well as discipline-specific research expertise, the proposal must include at least one funded or unfunded collaborator with expertise relevant to the targeted research discipline.
The OAC Core Research program supports and sustains advancements in multiple disciplinary areas spanning computer as well as computational and data-driven science and engineering with advanced CI thrusts. OAC projects must address new CI frontiers for discovery and lead to major innovations. The OAC Core Research areas include architectures and middleware for extreme-scale systems, scalable algorithms and applications, and the advanced CI ecosystem more broadly. Examples of research topics supported by OAC include, but are not limited to, the following:

Research in architecture for extreme-scale systems may include design, benchmarking, and analysis of extreme-scale systems for performance, programmability, and usability; storage, networks, and input/output (I/O); data centers and extreme-scale networked systems; and next-generation architectures;


Research in middleware may include resource management, monitoring, fault tolerance, and cybersecurity;


Research in scalable algorithms and applications shall be driven by science and engineering applications and may include numerical and high-performance scientific computing methods; data, software, and visualization approaches; and modeling and simulation capabilities; and


Research in the advanced CI ecosystem may include research in programming languages, libraries, and related environments; performance tuning and interoperability tools; shared CI, e.g., platforms and gateways; and sociotechnical aspects relevant to the advanced CI ecosystem, e.g., best practices, standards, policies, and virtual organizations.

Such translational CI research should be aimed towards realizing next-generation, extreme-scale research CI. Research in next-generation hardware and software systems should aim to increase coherence between the technology base used for modeling and simulation and that used for data analytics, as articulated in the NSCI, allowing dynamic interaction between analysis and simulation. OAC Core Research should also aim to enable an enduring national advanced CI ecosystem allowing dynamic interaction of computation with other elements of CI, such as scientific instruments, large data repositories, and mobile devices; integrating security and privacy as foundational elements; and significantly enhancing productivity in the development and use of parallel HPC applications.

"OCE Research Experiences for Undergraduates Sites (OCE REU Sites)","The REU Sites program in the Division of Ocean Sciences is part of an NSF-wide program under a single solicitation administered individually by each NSF Directorate and/or Division. In the Geosciences Directorate, each Division administers the program. An REU Site should provide research opportunities with a coherent intellectual theme and may be based in a single discipline or academic department or be interdisciplinary and multi-departmental.
The NSF-wide Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) solicitation governs the overall competition. The following clarifications/explanations are specifically for REU Site proposals submitted to the Division of Ocean Sciences.

Three years is typically the maximum project duration for OCE REU Sites. Longer durations may be considered, but discussion with the cognizant Program Officer prior to submission is encouraged.
Usually, at least 80% or more of OCE REU participants come from outside the host institution.
OCE REU Sites usually host 10 students per year; however, Sites that are located at small field stations or remote locations with limited faculty members sometimes host fewer students. Sites with large numbers of faculty may host more than 10 students. Discussion with the cognizant Program Officer is encouraged prior to submission of the proposal.
OCE REU mentors normally supervise one REU student. Including additional supervision by postdoctoral fellows or graduate students is encouraged.
A typical budget in the OCE REU program supports 1 month of summer salary per year for program management by the PI. Sites may distribute this FTE as needed to the PI, co-PI, research mentors, and other student assistants or program assistants. Evaluation costs are considered separate.
OCE REU Site budgets at remote field stations tend to be above the $1,300 per student per week guideline in the REU solicitation. Budgets in excess of the guideline may also be justified for extraordinary circumstances such as international sites, support for student cohorts with unusual needs, or dispersed sites.

Interested PIs are advised to explore the Online Directory of OCE REU Sites to determine the scope and breadth of fields funded under our program.

"Capacity: Cyberinfrastructure","The Cyberinfrastructure Programmatic Area supports the implementation of, scaling of, or major improvement to cyberinfrastructure for biology that advances or transforms contemporary biology and that is broadly applicable to a wide range of researchers. Proposed projects may include cyberinfrastructure related to any level of biological phenomena (e.g., molecular, cellular organismal, ecosystem, biome), but there needs to be a clear articulation of how the proposed capacity will lead to scientific understanding in biology. PIs are encouraged, where possible, to leverage existing resources in lieu of acquiring or developing new ones. Examples using existing resources include: using shared computational or storage hardware such as xSede, Open Science Grid, or JetStream; incorporating existing software or middleware for basic services (e.g., cyber security or user identity management); and deploying new software through existing platforms such as CyVerse, Galaxy, or R. The scope of the proposed infrastructure can include but is not limited to: design and construction of databases from new or existing data sources; software and methods for making use of new technologies for the acquisition, communication or visualization of biological data; software or ontologies related to data discovery, data mining, data integration or visualization; tools that facilitate biological research workflows, analytical pathways, or integration between the field and laboratory or between observations, experiments, and models; or scientific gateways (i.e., accessing shared computational and data resources). It is expected that projects will produce a finished product that is publicly accessible and useable for the biological research community. Projects are expected to produce quality products, result in important science outcomes that will be achieved by the users of the resource, and have the potential to be used by a community of researchers beyond a single research team. ",,,1,505538,nsf23580,Cleared,2018-08-31,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/capacity-cyberinfrastructure/pd18-1165,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/capacity-infrastructure-capacity-biological-research/nsf23-580/solicitation
"Capacity: Biological Collections","The Biological Collections Programmatic Area supports major improvements to or digitization of biological collections and collection-based information, enabling the advancement of biological understanding in important research areas, and increasing the broader applicability of collections.  Types of biological collections that are supported include established vouchered biological and paleontological collections, established living stocks and culture collections, and jointly-curated ancillary collections such as preserved tissues and libraries of genetic and genomic materials. Biological research collections provide critical research infrastructure for the biological sciences by allowing researchers to conduct a range of research including: documenting biodiversity and ecosystems, understanding species, evolution and organismal systems, quantifying environmental shifts, and providing knowledge for agricultural, biomedical, and manufacturing efforts. The scope of the proposed projects include either: improvements that secure existing biological collections (including ownership transfer), or thematic-based digitization projects that increase research potential and accessibility of biological collections-related data. Requests for improvements should demonstrate a clear and urgent need. Digitization requests must align with research priorities and should define, or partner with, a thematic network of collections that extends the value of the specimens for research.  Projects that are not supported in this programmatic area are establishment of new collections or living stocks, collecting activities, single-taxon natural history collections that are narrowly-focused, federally-owned collections, or digitization of literature sources, observation records, or other library items. Projects are expected to produce quality products, result in important science outcomes that will be achieved by the users of the resource, and have the potential to be used by a community of researchers beyond a single research team.
Proposed projects are expected to provide:

Evidence of the collection's importance to NSF BIO-funded research or biological conservation on a regional, national, or international scale.
A description of how the value of the collection will be enhanced by support from the Biological Collections programmatic area and how its contributions will further advance biological sciences.
Demonstration of an organizational commitment to adequate staffing and operating support that will result in long-term maintenance of the collection, associated data, and ancillary products.
Education and outreach contributions related to the collection's activities and demonstration of how the collection contributes to public understanding and appreciation of science and the diversity of life.

Improvements to biological collections
Established Vouchered Biological and Paleontological Collections. Requests will be considered to make improvements in established voucher collections for sustained, accurate, and efficient accessibility of the collection to the biological research community. Such improvements include, but are not limited to, securing and organizing specimens and related data, and increasing the accessibility of these data. Collections supported include those housing complete specimens of organisms, parts of organisms, or direct artifacts of organisms (e.g., recorded sounds and fossilized footprints) and ancillary data such as preserved tissues and/or other physical samples. Also eligible are collections that maintain ancillary material documenting the environmental context of the primary organism (e.g., soil and water samples, temperature and precipitation records, specimen-based geographic information, field notes). Only ancillary material that can be linked to vouchered specimens will be considered eligible. Established Living Stocks and Culture Collections. Funding can be provided to secure and improve existing collections of living organisms (including viruses and bacteriophages) used in NSF BIO-funded basic biological research. Proposals will be considered that implement innovative handling of living stocks or demonstrate well-defined improvements in existing collections. Support for establishing new collections or collecting specimens is not allowable.Requests are expected to describe activities that emphasize the security, maintenance, and provision of living organisms. Support for development of derivatives (e.g., genetic data) or other material relevant to the study of the sources may be provided but support for original research by collection staff on these derivatives or other materials should be sought from appropriate research programs at NSF, and at other public and private agencies. When appropriate, the collection should interface with relevant national efforts that provide an integrated framework for collections data.
Transfer of Ownership. Funding may be requested to move valuable established collections to a new institutional home or to consolidate collections. Requests for moving or consolidating must include an explicit plan for the activity. Proposals may target either Living Stocks or Vouchered Biological or Paleontological Collections. Proposals may include opportunities to salvage a significant collection that otherwise would be lost, or to preserve collections that facilitate critical knowledge discovery or that enable substantial growth in a scientific discipline. Authorization of ownership transfer and moving estimates should be documented (see Infrastructure Capacity for Biology solicitation; Authorities and Cost Basis) as Supplementary Documents.
Thematic-based Digitization of Biological Collections. Proposed digitization projects are expected to enhance the national resource of digital data documenting existing vouchered biological and paleontological collections. Proposals are encouraged that establish or extend research-ready networks where existing specimens and digital media connect to associated data, including genetic, phenotypic, behavioral, or environmental data that comprise an extended Thematic Collection Network (TCN) or as a Partner to an Existing Network (PEN). A TCN should conform to the concepts of an ""Extended Specimen Network"" described by the NSF funded BCON Research Coordination Network. These concepts convey a ""perspective of the biodiversity specimen as extending beyond the singular physical object, to potentially limitless additional physical preparations and digital resources."" At the same time, digitization efforts should remain focused on a research theme and the physical specimens owned by the collections involved. Paleontological collections are included and may be integrated with biological collections if relevant to a research theme or may be digitized around a biological research theme unique to the past. Awardees are expected to be engaged in collaboration with national and international scale partners (e.g., iDigBio) for training activities, outreach, and the development of appropriate technology and standards to produce an interoperable network.
Proposals should present innovative plans, strong collaborations among large and small institutions, and mechanisms to build upon existing digitization projects. Proposals that increase efficiency and breadth are a priority. Collaboration with federally held collections is encouraged, but digitization of federal collections cannot be supported with NSF funds. However, specimens owned by federal institutions may be pertinent for a research theme. In those cases, plans for integration of the existing data from all specimens should be articulated (for example, by including representatives from the federal collection as meeting participants, sharing workflows and file formats, etc.).
Thematic Collection Networks (TCNs). Proposals should describe two- to four-year projects to digitize existing specimens based on a research-ready theme. Specimens to be digitized should be of critical importance to the research theme and the criteria for the specimen assessment should be indicated in the proposal. Shared infrastructure among the collections involved should be identified along with deliverables that support the research-ready theme of the project. Proposals should define metrics for assessment, identify specific needs for community involvement, and demonstrate links to other collections related to the digitization effort. Priority is given to projects that approach digitization in innovative ways, through integration of data, methodology and techniques that are cost effective, and drive down the financial and personnel costs of digitization of specimens and/or speed up the process of digitization.
Partnerships to Existing Networks (PENs). Proposals that partner with and extend the efforts of ongoing NSF-funded TCNs are encouraged. New partners must increase the number of specimens digitized in the ongoing project and fill gaps not addressed by the specimens in an existing TCN. Any TCN which is either in progress on its NSF award or which has established itself as a sustainable entity (i.e. part of professional society activities, part of regional collaborations at the universities, or supported by funding other than NSF) is eligible for including new partners. It is expected that PEN proposals will work with the TCN to develop a budget that is compatible with these collaborative projects. The PEN proposals should adequately indicate how the partner collection will add information to the ongoing project, fill in gaps in digitized data and increase value to the efforts for the research theme. The broader impacts should be specific for the PEN institution, but also indicate how these impacts enhance the TCN. To indicate that the PEN will appropriately integrate with the existing TCN, a letter of collaboration (format found under the instructions for Supplemental Documents, below) from the lead of the existing TCN should be uploaded in the Supplemental Documents section. It is expected that PEN proposals will use some of the infrastructure of the existing network, thus providing an efficient means to further the impact of the existing network. The length of a PEN proposal should be adequate to describe the activity and the integration into the existing network; a full 15 pages may not be necessary for these types of proposals.",,,1,505541,nsf23580,Cleared,2018-08-31,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/capacity-biological-collections/pd18-1197,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/capacity-infrastructure-capacity-biological-research/nsf23-580/solicitation
"Capacity: Biological Field Stations and Marine Laboratories (FSML)","The Biological Field Stations and Marine Laboratories Programmatic Area supports major improvements to biological field stations or laboratories in any terrestrial, marine, estuarine, or freshwater environment for research and education. Such field stations and laboratories play a critical role in: providing access to study areas and organisms; providing facilities and equipment close to study areas; and fostering an atmosphere of mutual scientific interest and collaboration in biological research and education. The scope of proposed infrastructure improvements in this programmatic area can include, but is not limited to: equipment, communications, data management, or physical plant improvement. Proposals should focus on well-defined and significant efforts rather than a compilation of small improvements. Projects are expected to produce quality products, have important science or education outcomes that will be achieved by the users of the resource, and have  the potential to be used by a community of researchers, educators, or students beyond a single research team.
Improvement proposals
The proposal should address the potential for the proposed improvement to increase extensibility, portability, or interoperability that enhances the station's capacity to support larger scale or replicated biological research. Improvements that directly benefit multiple stations may be proposed, but PIs must first consult with the cognizant program director regarding eligibility before submission.  All aspects of the request must be justified by a clear and unified advance in research capability. Requests for multiple unrelated components or predominantly miscellaneous, low-cost supplies will receive lowest priority. Improvement proposals may include the following:

Improvements in the physical plant of a field station or marine laboratory. Such requests may include renovations to the physical structures on the station that are to be used for research, for training and education activities, or for temporary accommodations intended for visiting scientists and students. Limited support is available for new construction, and priority is for facilities that advance research capacity such as labs, greenhouses, or other structures with specialized research functions. This program will not consider improvements to:  (1) administrative, classroom, or office space;  (2) maintenance, repairs, or replacements of existing infrastructure that do not advance research capability beyond a prior state; or, (3) facilities or equipment used for research or educational activities on board a University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research ship or similar vessel (such requests should be directed to Oceanographic Facilities and Equipment Support in the Division of Ocean Sciences at: http://nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504848&org=OCE)
Improvements in or new equipment. Such requests should be for major, shared-use items (including special purpose vehicles and boats) that are directly essential to the facility's research activities as well as associated training and education programs. These items should enhance and expand the research capabilities of the facility and attract additional users to the facility.
Improvements in or new observational or experimental infrastructure. Such requests may include fixed infrastructure such as towers, sensors/gauges, manipulative features, and other facilities used in support of research and data collection activities.
Improvements in or new data management and communication systems. Such requests should be directed at deployment of appropriate, up-to-date technology and should be directed toward broad community use of such systems for research, training, and dissemination.

Planning proposals  
Planning proposals should focus on long-term strategic planning for growth or redirection in the facility's science and education programs. The outcome of these projects is usually a 5 to 10 year strategic plan that will be made publicly available and provide vision for the future of the facility and an actionable plan for how it will be achieved. They should not be focused on short term planning or design for specific improvements. While not a prerequisite, field stations and marine labs that have undergone periodic planning activities are often better prepared to write improvement proposals.","standard, continuing",,1,5449,nsf23580,Cleared,2018-08-31,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/fsml-capacity-biological-field-stations-marine-laboratories/pd18-1104,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/capacity-infrastructure-capacity-biological-research/nsf23-580/solicitation

"WINDOWS ON THE UNIVERSE: THE ERA OF MULTI-MESSENGER ASTROPHYSICS (WoU-MMA)","The Universe is the ultimate laboratory, and we can now probe it as never before through several powerful and diverse windows – electromagnetic waves, high-energy particles, and gravitational waves.  Each of these windows provides a different view.  Together they reveal a detailed picture of the Universe that will allow us to study matter, energy, and the cosmos in fundamentally new ways.
The “Windows on the Universe” Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (WoU-MMA) program identifies three categories of messengers - electromagnetic waves, high-energy particles including neutrinos and cosmic rays, and gravitational waves. The goals of WoU-MMA are to build the capabilities and accelerate the synergy between observations and theory to realize integrated, multi-messenger astrophysical explorations of the Universe.
The WoU-MMA program welcomes proposals in any area of research supported through the participating divisions that address at least one of the following criteria:

Coordination: Activities to coordinate observations involving more than one messenger. 
Observations: Observations of astrophysical objects or phenomena that are potentially sources of more than one messenger. 
Interpretation: Theory, experiment, simulations and other activities to understand or interpret observations of astrophysical objects that are sources of more than one messenger.

Competitive proposals will accelerate the progress in multi-messenger astrophysics and advance the community activities that have been developed during the initial five-year period of the WoU-MMA program.  These build on observational and analysis capabilities at the intersection of the explorations enabled by each of the three windows. Efforts to integrate research communities to develop full interoperability between the three windows, and to develop a skilled new workforce in this field, are also encouraged.

"Mind, Machine and Motor Nexus (M3X)","The Mind, Machine and Motor Nexus (M3X) Program supports fundamental research that explores embodied reasoning as mediated by bidirectional sensorimotor interaction between human and synthetic actors. For the purposes of this program, embodiment is defined as the capacity to interact with physics-based environments.  
Interaction between human and synthetic actors is expanding in scale and scope across numerous fields and endeavors. Among these are areas where safety and performance are paramount, but also where ingenuity and risk-taking are essential to success. The M3X Program seeks to spur innovative and path-breaking work that can improve understanding of interaction between human and synthetic actors in a broad range of settings, while also exploring implications for the advancement of fundamental theory, foundational technologies, and meaningful applications. Successful submissions to the M3X program will therefore advance knowledge by exploring the convergence of human and synthetic actors’ capabilities and actions during the performance of tasks situated within physics-based environments.
The following key concepts define the M3X program and therefore must be captured in any competitive proposal submitted to the program:

Human and Synthetic Actors, which refer respectively to human beings and to embodied constructs with the additional capacity for engaging in sensorimotor interactions (defined below) as enabled by a potentially wide range of capabilities such as sensing, reasoning, communicating, interacting, and learning. Competitive proposals to the M3X program must consider the interaction between at least one human actor and at least one synthetic actor.
Sensorimotor interaction, which refers to the exchange of information between at least one human actor and at least one synthetic actor through any sensorimotor channel (e.g., haptic, visual, etc.) available to human or synthetic actors in real, virtual or hybrid environments. This interaction must be bidirectional between human and synthetic actors.
Embodied reasoning, which refers to the capability of human and synthetic actors to engage in cognitive activities that produce knowledge or expectations about each other (e.g., via intent detection, trust-building, social engagement, etc.). Such capability must be enabled or evolved through sensorimotor interaction, in a physics-based environment. Other aspects of embodied reasoning—such as understanding of task requirements or of the environment within which co-activities are embedded—may also be present.
Physics-based environment, which refers to a real and/or simulated environment where laws of physics are defined and applied to objects and to interactions within that environment.

The M3X program encourages research on sensorimotor interaction and embodied reasoning between human and synthetic actors in real, virtual, or hybrid settings, over a range of spatial and temporal scales, and for different modes of interaction. The M3X program supports research derived from conceptual, mathematical, empirical, experimental, computational, and cross-cutting perspectives, among others. Multi-disciplinary perspectives are encouraged but must be integrated to promote a holistic treatment of the research.
Topics of interest to the M3X program include — but are by no means limited to — collaboration, cooperation, and competition among human and synthetic actors; the role of virtual, mixed and hybrid environments in decision making and learning; new approaches to modeling, guiding and controlling processes of reasoning and interaction; as well as the development of research infrastructure (including open source instrumentation, models, data and environments) that will accelerate research in this area.
Proposals that do not engage each of the three concepts listed above (i.e., human and synthetic actors linked through sensorimotor interaction and with capabilities for embodied reasoning) may be returned without review. Research involving only a single human actor or a single synthetic actor is not appropriate for the M3X program and should be directed towards other NSF programs. Similarly, research that does not include interaction with a physics-based environment, such as interaction between actors based exclusively on language or exchange of characters on a screen, is also not appropriate for the M3X program.",,,1,505402,pd19058Y,Cleared,2018-06-11,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/m3x-mind-machine-motor-nexus/pd19-058y,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/policies/pappg
"Humans, Disasters, and the Built Environment (HDBE)","The Humans, Disasters, and the Built Environment (HDBE) program supports fundamental, convergent research on how human activities and behaviors interact with the built environment to reduce or exacerbate the effects of natural hazards and disasters. The program foci are ongoing and emerging hazards to populations (individuals, households, businesses, organizations, and agencies) and built environments (critical infrastructures, physical and cyber spaces, and buildings). Successful proposals shall address all three elements (i.e., humans, disasters, and the built environment) and have the potential to contribute to theories or insights that hold over a broad range of scales, conditions, and sectors. Research funded through this program is expected to build a deeper understanding of human behaviors at the interface of engineering and society and inform how communities manage their risk and adapt to changing patterns in climate, extreme weather, and other hazards.
Given the richness of the phenomena under study, the HDBE program seeks research that advances foundational theories, methods, and data within and across diverse disciplines such as engineering, social sciences, natural sciences, computing, or other relevant fields. Interdisciplinary proposals are common.
Proposals aimed to make methodological contributions to advance disaster-relevant research are also of interest to the program. Examples include methods and tools for the translation of engineering solutions (mitigation and adaptation) for the built environment to community or national scale investments, practices, and policies; techniques to examine the interactions of humans and the built environment resulting from simultaneous or compounding risk of natural disasters and pandemics; and protocols, methodologies, and tools tailored for handling sensitive, protected, and proprietary data relevant to disasters.
Investigators are encouraged to take advantage of NSF’s investments in the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) on experimental testing, computational modeling and simulation, interdisciplinary training and networks, and data sharing, integration, and analysis. Research that addresses multiple dimensions of social equity, vulnerability, and environmental justice is particularly encouraged.
Proposers are actively encouraged to email a one-page project summary to the HDBE Program Officer before submitting a full proposal for guidance on whether the proposed research topic falls within the scope of the HDBE program and/or co-review might be appropriate.

Proposals that explore and build upon advanced computing techniques and tools to enable major advances in mechanics are particularly welcome. For example, proposals incorporating reduced-order modeling, data-driven techniques, and/or stochastic methods with a strong emphasis on validation are encouraged.  Also welcome are proposals addressing data analytics for deformation or damage response deduction from large experimental and computational data sets. Similarly, proposals that explore new experimental techniques to capture deformation and failure information for extreme ranges of loading or material behavior are also encouraged. Finally, experimental and computational methods that address information across multiple length and time scales, potentially involving multiphysics considerations are also welcome.
Proposals with a focus on buildings and civil infrastructure system are welcome in CMMI and should be submitted to the program on Structural and Architectural Engineering Materials (SAEM). Proposals addressing processing and mechanical performance enhancements should be submitted to the Materials Engineering and Processing (MEP) program. Investigators with proposals focused on design methodological approaches and theory enabling the accelerated development and insertion of materials should consider the Design of Engineering Material Systems (DEMS) program.

"Engineering for Civil Infrastructure (ECI)","The Engineering for Civil Infrastructure (ECI) program supports fundamental research in geotechnical, structural, materials, architectural, and coastal engineering. The ECI program promotes research that can shape the future of the nation’s physical civil infrastructure and that can contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation, and hazards and disaster resilience. Types of civil infrastructure that the ECI program considers include, but are not limited to, buildings, residential construction, earth and earth retaining structures, and components of flood protection systems; water, waste disposal, and wastewater systems; energy infrastructure (excluding nuclear); and transportation systems (excluding pavements). Both disciplinary and convergent research that can address the challenges of physical civil infrastructure to be resilient and sustainable over its service lifetime are of particular interest. Broader  impacts of ECI research include fostering community welfare for an equitable and prosperous nation and promoting environmentally friendly, circular economy policies.
The ECI program supports research that advances knowledge on the behavior of physical civil infrastructure subjected to and interacting with the natural environment during construction; under service and long-term conditions, including increased demands due to climate change adaptation and other emerging stressors; and under conditions caused by single or multiple extreme hazard events (extreme weather, windstorms, earthquakes, tsunamis, storm surges, landslides, and fire, including wildland-urban interface fire). The ECI program also supports research on geomaterials and infrastructure materials utilized in load-bearing systems as well as in non-structural systems. Of particular interest is experimental and analytical/computational research to advance the fundamental understanding of coupled multi-physics, multi-scale (spatial and temporal), multi-functional behavior of these materials and their intended use in civil infrastructure.
The ECI program supports research on civil infrastructure that contributes to the National Science Foundation’s role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). Principal Investigators are encouraged to leverage NSF’s investments in the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) experimental, computational modeling and simulation, and data resources (https://www.designsafe-ci.org/) in their research to accelerate advances needed for reducing the impacts of natural hazards on civil infrastructure. The NHERI Science Plan (https://www.designsafe-ci.org/facilities/nco/science-plan/) offers a range of research topics that could benefit from the use of NHERI resources and are relevant to the ECI program.
The ECI program does not support research that addresses natural resource exploration or recovery, investigates blasts and explosions, develops sensor and measurement technologies, or focuses on hazard characterization. The ECI program only supports fundamental research topics for civil infrastructure with a strong grounding in theory. Topics which fall within the mission for research and/or development of other federal and state agencies are appropriate for the ECI program only when addressing fundamental scientific questions. Research on natural hazard characterization is supported through programs in the NSF Directorate for Geosciences.
Proposers are actively encouraged to email a one-page project summary to the ECI Program Officers before submitting a full proposal for guidance on whether the proposed research topic falls within the scope of the ECI program; this guidance especially should be requested for multi-disciplinary research proposals, proposals for which research and/or development on the subject civil infrastructure(s) are also supported by other federal and state agencies, and proposals that consider civil infrastructure not listed above.",,,1,505488,pd19073Y,Cleared,2018-06-11,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/eci-engineering-civil-infrastructure/pd19-073y,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/policies/pappg
"Engineering Design and Systems Engineering (EDSE)","The Engineering Design and Systems Engineering (EDSE) program supports fundamental research that advances design science and/or systems science through the creation of new knowledge about the design of engineered artifacts. Engineered artifacts include, but are not limited to, devices, products, processes, platforms, materials, organizations, systems, and systems of systems. The program focuses on design as a system, in which designers, the artifacts they create, the methods they use to create them, and the environment in which this occurs are all subject to rigorous scientific inquiry, along with the interactions among these elements.
The EDSE program strongly encourages proposals that embrace the multidisciplinary nature of design and supports well-defined collaborations of experts in design science and/or systems science with experts in other domains, including (but not limited to) the social, behavioral, computational, and natural (biological and physical) sciences. Competitive proposals will be firmly grounded in theory, will demonstrate the potential of the proposed work to improve design, and will include a plan to rigorously assess the performance and effectiveness of the proposed research methods across all domains involved.
In particular, the EDSE program supports fundamental contributions in areas that include but are not limited to design representation; design optimization; design validation; mechanism design; robotics and intelligent system design; design of engineered materials systems; design cognition; design collaboration; data science and artificial intelligence in design; design in under-resourced communities; immersive design; and design at extreme scales and in extreme environments.

"Biomechanics and Mechanobiology (BMMB)","The Biomechanics and Mechanobiology (BMMB) program is part of the Mechanics of Materials cluster within the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation.
The BMMB program supports fundamental and transformative research that advances our understanding of engineering biomechanics and/or mechanobiology.  The program emphasizes the study of biological mechanics across multiple domains, from sub-cellular to whole organism.  Distinct from conventional engineering materials, the program encourages the consideration of diverse living tissues as smart materials that are self-designing. 
BMMB projects must have a clear biological component, a clear mechanics component, and must improve our understanding of the mechanical behavior of a living system. Investigations of the mechanical behavior of biological molecules, cells, tissues, and living systems are welcome.  An important concern is the influence of in vivo mechanical forces on cell and matrix biology in the histomorphogenesis, maintenance, regeneration, repair, and aging of tissues and organs.  The program is also interested in efforts to translate recent biomechanical and mechanobiological discoveries into engineering science. 
Multiscale mechanics approaches are encouraged but not required. Projects may include theoretical, computational, or experimental approaches, or a combination thereof.  NSF does not support clinical trials; however, feasibility studies involving human volunteers or animal subjects may be supported if appropriate to the scientific objectives of the project.
Proposals should address the novelty and/or potentially transformative nature of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field.  Also, it is essential to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, and to state the potential impact of success in the research on society and/or industry. 
Innovative proposals outside of these specific areas of biomechanics and mechanobiology will be considered.  However, prior to submission of particularly unique topics, it is strongly recommended that Principal Investigators (PIs) contact the program director to discuss how the proposed work fits within the scope of the program and avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.
Related programs also fund certain aspects of biomechanics and mechanobiology research, and PIs are encouraged to examine these to find the appropriate program for submission.  Proposals with a heavy emphasis on tissue engineering or developing validated models of tissue and organ systems should consider the Engineering of Biomedical Systems (EBMS) program. Projects addressing biological questions about the physiological mechanisms and structural features of organisms should consult the Physiological Mechanisms & Biomechanics (PMB) program. Projects elucidating aspects of neural control may consider the Perception, Action, & Cognition (PAC) program or the Mind, Machine, and Motor Nexus (M3X) program if the project contains work relevant to human-machine interaction.  Projects in rehabilitation engineering should consider the Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering (DARE) program.  Projects focused on fundamental research related to design, characterization, and modification of biomaterials should consider the Biomaterials (BMAT) program. Manufacturing systems proposals should consider the Advanced Manufacturing (AM) program. Work on the interplay between structure, dynamics, and function of biomolecules without advancing our understanding of the mechanics of a living system should consider the Molecular Biophysics program. Researchers who believe their work may span multiple programs are particularly encouraged to contact the cognizant program directors well in advance of submission. 
The duration of unsolicited proposal awards is generally up to three years; proposals for a shorter duration are welcome.  Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent trainee) and up to one month of PI time per year (awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets or durations that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the program director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the “What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)” link towards the bottom of this page.

"Chemical Structure and Dynamics Program (CSD)","The Chemical Structure and Dynamics (CSD) Program, formerly named Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program, supports research projects that advance foundational knowledge on the nature of chemical structure and bonding, electronic structure, and chemical dynamics. At coarse resolution, the CSD Program encompasses the sub-disciplines of experimental physical chemistry and applied computational physical chemistry, and it is interested in projects that enable physical phenomena to be viewed in a new light or in ways that challenge current paradigms. To that end, projects of interest to CSD often rely heavily on the use or advancement of sophisticated experimental techniques (e.g., state-selective methods, time and frequency domain spectroscopies, microscopies, single-molecule methods, scattering and diffraction approaches, and surface characterization techniques) or the development of new analysis approaches to further physical understanding. The chemical systems studied range in complexity and include isolated molecules and molecular ions, liquids, clusters, surfaces and interfaces, molecular assemblies and films, nanoscale systems, and biological structures. The CSD Program also supports applied computational chemistry that demonstrates strong synergy with experiment. Investigators who plan to submit proposals on primarily computational projects are advised that their proposals will be reviewed by experimentalists and experts in computational chemistry.
The CSD Program also encourages proposal submissions in the following topical areas: The CSD Program is interested in projects that would advance our understanding of key Quantum Information Science (QIS) concepts in molecular and nanoscopic systems or use QIS concepts to probe chemical systems in new ways. Through the Critical Aspects of Sustainability (CAS) program, the Division of Chemistry looks to support basic research aimed at improving the sustainability of resources for future generations while maintaining or improving current products within a global society. Examples of topics related to sustainable chemistry appropriate for the CSD Program include, but are not limited to describing correlated chemical and physical processes across multiple time and length scales in functional systems; combining computational and experimental approaches to predict and measure the physical properties of sustainable catalysts, chemicals, and materials; and investigating fundamental dynamical processes in the context of functional networks for clean energy generation and storage technologies. Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) proposals, where such advances are connected directly to industrial considerations, are also encouraged.
Research topics that are not of interest to the CSD Program: Projects addressing questions in nanochemistry, or chemistry of biological systems may wish to consult the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) or Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) Programs, respectively. Proposals for projects whose primary goal is the development of an entirely new instrumental technique, or enhanced performance or understanding of an existing technique, may be more appropriate for the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program. In general, research focused on solid-state chemical processes is not supported by CSD. Investigators interested in this area should consult with the Solid State Materials Chemistry (SSMC) Program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR). Projects for which the primary goal is the development of a practical device are not supported by the CSD Program and should be submitted to an appropriate program in the Engineering Directorate.

"Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI)","The Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program supports research focusing on chemically-relevant measurement science and chemical imaging. Projects may target development of innovative approaches and instruments likely to be of use to the chemistry community, and/or improved understanding of new and existing methods. Research areas include, but are not limited to, analytical separation science; electroanalytical chemistry; and spectrometry (including atomic, molecular, magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry). Development of new chemical imaging and measurement tools that probe chemical properties and processes is supported. Innovations enabling the monitoring and imaging of chemical and electronic processes across a wide range of time and length scales are also relevant. New approaches to data analysis and interpretation (including cheminformatics) are encouraged. Proposals addressing established techniques must seek improved understanding and/or innovative approaches to substantially broaden applicability. Sensor-related proposals are expected to address new approaches to chemical sensing, with prospects for broad utility and significant enhancement of current capabilities. 
Proposals addressing development of new instrumentation that enables chemical measurements likely to be of wide interest and utility to the chemistry research community should include the words ""Instrument Development:"" at the beginning of the title, and include, in the Project Description, consideration of a development timeline, potential utility, and prospects for the extension of the technique to other uses or fields, should it prove viable.
The CMI Program is also interested in proposal submissions in the following topical areas: Industrial partnerships are encouraged through the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) mechanism as means of enhancing use by the greater community, but concepts nearing commercialization are better fits to Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs.
Proposals integrating innovative computational approaches with CMI-relevant research, such as those enabling efficient and effective data acquisition and analysis, are encouraged and should be submitted to the CMI Program through the Computational and Data Science and Engineering (CDS&E) funding opportunity.

"NSF Mathematical Sciences Graduate Internship","The National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) aims to provide opportunities to enrich the training of graduate doctoral students in the Mathematical Sciences through the provision of a NSF DMS funded summer research internship program. Towards this objective, DMS has partnered with the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) which is managed by Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) for the Department of Energy, to establish the NSF Mathematical Sciences Graduate Internship program.
The program aims to support approximately forty internships annually, primarily at the National Laboratories. The longer-term goals are to expand the program and to include private industries and nonprofit organizations as hosts. The program is intended to introduce doctoral students in mathematics to interesting applications of mathematical or statistical theories outside of academia. The internships are aimed at students who are interested in understanding the application of advanced mathematical and statistical techniques to ""real world"" problems, regardless of whether they plan to pursue an academic or nonacademic career.
The NSF Mathematical Sciences Graduate Internship program is expected to have significant benefits for several groups of stakeholders, including:

For all participating graduate students: Enhanced understanding of their research areas in a broader context.
For graduate students who pursue academic careers: Preparation to take mathematical inspiration from problems in disciplines outside of the mathematical sciences, allowing them to initiate development of new areas in mathematical sciences; preparation to serve as links in their future faculty appointments between academics and the business/industry/government/non-profit realm; and preparation to advise their future students on the full range of possible career paths that exist with training in the mathematical sciences.
For graduate students who pursue careers outside academics: Better preparation for, and knowledge of, a wide range of career paths in areas of business, industry, government, and non-profits where the mathematical sciences play increasingly important roles.
For faculty: Ph.D. interns who return to the academic setting with enhanced understanding of the research area in a broader context.
For academic departments: Enhanced ties to activities outside the university, and better career opportunities for graduate students.
For the mathematical sciences community: Demonstration of the impact of an enriched training for doctoral students generally.

Students in full-time enrollment as a graduate student at an accredited US college or university located in the US during the academic year preceding the internship will be considered. They should be pursuing a doctoral degree in the mathematical sciences and be able to provide two relevant letters of recommendation. These letters should address the student's academic record and potential for success in an internship, as indicated by communication and teamwork skills.

"Solid State and Materials Chemistry","All proposals submitted to this Program that are not governed by another solicitation (such as CAREER) must be submitted to the solicitation: Division of Materials Research: Topical Materials Research Programs (DMR:TMRP) (NSF 22-609). Proposals under this solicitation are accepted any time.
 Proposers should be aware that there is no change expected in the average time to decision and release of reviews. Considering that NSF’s fiscal year begins on October 1st and ends on September 30th, proposals submitted between February and August are more likely to be awarded in the following fiscal year.
 The multidisciplinary Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program portfolio comprises fundamental research on organic, inorganic, and hybrid materials with an emphasis on synthesis and structure-property relationship studies. The SSMC program supports fundamental research focused on experimentally elucidating atomic and molecular underpinnings for materials development and properties of extended solid-state materials, spanning the entire range from nanoscale assemblies to the bulk. The SSMC program particularly encourages research encompassing multicomponent materials systems, a strong mesoscale aspect, and/or interface-related phenomena with regard to materials properties.
 The SSMC program encourages potentially transformative submissions at the frontiers of solid-state and materials chemistry research, which include but are not limited to:
1) Crystallization and crystal growth studies of organic and inorganic materials. 2) Synthesis of hybrid materials and fundamental investigations into their emergent properties. 3) Development of original materials design principles and approaches to innovative design, including proposals with a machine-learning aspect. 4) Studies correlating materials properties of framework materials, nanomaterial assemblies, or 2D materials to their structure and/or components. 5) Development and fundamental investigation of novel material systems for energy harvesting, conversion, and storage. Research in this area will be considered only if the objective of the study is advancing insights into fundamental materials chemistry challenges through systematic investigations rather than improving performance. Submissions related to synthesis and characterization of next generation “beyond Li-ion” battery materials are encouraged. 6) The SSMC program also welcomes proposals on all materials aspects of sustainability under the Critical Aspects of Sustainability (CAS) program.
 All fundamental research projects targeting eventual end applications beyond the scope of the project submitted to the SSMC program, should use application-related device design or performance testing only as a characterization tool to inform materials chemistry questions within the context of structure-property relationship studies, rather than to improve performance.

While the SSMC program acknowledges the importance of computational materials chemistry and sees merit in studies that combine experimental and computational aspects, proposals submitted to the SSMC program need to contain at least an experimental validation component, if experimental materials chemistry is not the major focus of the research project.


Proposals with a significant emphasis on catalysis-related research that are submitted to the SSMC program may be discussed with program directors for the catalysis program in the ENG-CBET or MPS-CHE division, respectively. Proposals may either be transferred or reviewed jointly depending on the extent of alignment with the goals of both programs. PIs are strongly encouraged to contact the SSMC program to discuss the submission of proposals that potentially fall in this category. Submission deadlines for the intended secondary program need to be taken into consideration.


Proposals within the area of liquid crystal research that are submitted to the SSMC program will be discussed with the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) program and possibly either co-reviewed or transferred depending on the extent of alignment with the goals of both programs. PIs are strongly encouraged to contact the SSMC program to discuss the submission of proposals that potentially fall in this category.

Particle Physics seeks to explore the fundamental nature of matter, energy, space, and time. It asks such questions as: What are the origins of mass? Can the basic forces of nature be unified? How did the universe begin? How will it evolve in the future? What are dark matter and dark energy? Are there extra dimensions of space-time? Formerly separate questions in cosmology (the universe on the largest scales) and quantum phenomena (the universe on the smallest scales) become connected through our understanding that the early universe can be explored through the techniques of particle physics. These questions are addressed by programs in both theoretical and experimental particle physics in the Division of Physics.
The Particle Astrophysics – Experiment program is organized into the following subareas:
Particle Astrophysics – Cosmic Phenomena (1643): This area supports university research that uses astrophysical sources and particle physics techniques to study fundamental physics. This includes astrophysical sources of gamma-rays, cosmic-rays, and neutrinos (except IceCube).
Particle Astrophysics – Underground Physics (7235): This area supports university research that locates experiments in low background environments. Currently funded activities include studies of solar, underground, and reactor neutrinos; neutrino mass measurements; searches for the direct detection of Dark Matter.
Particle Astrophysics – IceCube Research Support (011Y): This area supports university research that utilizes the facilities of IceCube at the South Pole. Currently supported activities include: searches for ultra-high energy neutrinos and studies of the properties of neutrinos.

Nuclear physics ranges from the very tiny kernel at the center of all atoms to gigantic stars burning throughout the universe, as understood through the strong and electroweak interactions. It seeks to answer questions such as:　

What are the phases of strongly interacting matter and what roles do they play in the cosmos?


What is the internal structure of hadrons in terms of quarks and gluons?


What is the role of gluons in mesons, nucleons and nuclei?　


What is the nature of the nuclear force that binds protons and neutrons into stable nuclei and rare isotopes?　


How much mass do neutrinos have and could they be their own anti-particle? Could neutrinos help us understand why there is more matter than anti-matter in the universe?

Responding to these fundamental questions is part of human nature and leads students as well as other researchers to develop both innovative and incremental advances in nuclear physics and other fields.
The experimental nuclear physics program supports research at the frontiers of nuclear science, including: properties and behavior of nuclei and nuclear matter under extreme conditions, and/or as they relate to astrophysical phenomena; the quark-gluon basis for the structure and dynamics of hadrons and nuclei; phase transitions of nuclear matter from normal nuclear density and temperature to the predicted high-temperature quark-gluon plasma; basic interactions and fundamental symmetries; and neutrino properties as determined through neutrino-less double beta decay. This research involves many venues, including low-energy to multi-GeV electrons and photons; intermediate-energy light ions; low-energy to relativistic heavy ions, including radioactive beams; cold and ultra-cold neutrons; weakly decaying nuclei; as well as non-accelerator-based experiments. Proposals that include scientific scope outside the program may be co-reviewed with other programs within the Physics Division and/or other Divisions. Proposals submitted to the program that are determined to be more complex may, at the discretion of the Program Officer, be subjected to an additional level of review.
The program supports university user groups executing experiments at a large number of laboratories and facilities in the United States and abroad.  The program also supports smaller accelerator facilities, such as those at Florida State University and the University of Notre Dame.

The Elementary Particle Theory program encompasses different theoretical tools for understanding the interaction of elementary particles at different energy scales. These include String Theory, Quantum Field Theory, Lattice Field Theory, Effective Field Theories, and Phenomenology based on the above theoretical tools. The program supports both formal string theory as well as string-theory-inspired model building.  Proposals in mathematical physics that are relevant for string theory and/or quantum field theory are also relevant for this program.   Predictions for upcoming experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) involve Supersymmetric Model building, Grand Unified Theories, Extra Dimensions, String Inspired phenomenology as well as high order calculations in the Standard Model (of strong weak and electromagnetic interactions) to sort out what new physics might be discovered at the next generation of accelerators and cosmic ray and neutrino detectors. High precision simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes using lattice gauge theory are also a crucial ingredient for understanding present and future experiments at various collider facilities. Supported research includes contributions to broad theoretical advances as well as model building and applications to experimental programs at facilities such as the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Jefferson Laboratory, and to astrophysical phenomena. This includes formulating new approaches for theoretical, computational, and experimental research that explore the fundamental laws of physics and the behavior of physical systems; formulating quantitative hypotheses; exploring and analyzing the implications of such hypotheses analytically and computationally; and interpreting the results of experiments. The effort also includes a considerable number of interdisciplinary grants.

The Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Experimental Physics program (AMO-E) supports research that can be categorized by four broad, sometimes overlapping, sub-areas of the discipline: (1) Precision Measurements, (2) Ultracold Atoms and Molecules, (3) Optical Physics (including the ultrafast regime), and (4) Atomic and Molecular Spectroscopy or Collisions. Ions are included as a subset of Atoms and Molecules. The focus of research in the AMO-E program is on the fundamental quantitative understanding of atoms and molecules and their interaction with light, and the application of AMO methods to fundamental science in other disciplines in the Division (e.g., Nuclear Physics, Gravitational Physics, and Elementary Particle Physics). Examples of activities supported directly by the AMO-E program over the past decade include: quantum control, cooling and trapping of atoms and ions, low-temperature collision dynamics, the collective behavior of atoms in weakly interacting gases (Bose-Einstein condensates and dilute Fermi degenerate systems), precision measurements, the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics, the nonlinear response of isolated atoms to intense ultra-short electromagnetic fields, atom-cavity interaction at high fields, and quantum properties of the electromagnetic field.
More recently, the Program has increasing interest in precision measurement proposals to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model, to explore the classical-quantum boundary and the fundamental nature of entanglement and quantum coherence, to advance the foundations of quantum measurement and sensing, to probe the quantum vacuum (using ultraintense lasers or the internal Coulomb fields of highly charged ions), and to use controlled collections of cold atoms to simulate physics which naturally occurs in fields such as Condensed Matter Physics or Astrophysics.
NSF recognizes that some research projects within this Program, such as precision measurement projects, may require more than three years to realize demonstrable research outcomes. For these and other projects that might be better served to be on a cycle that is more well matched to the natural time scale of graduate student research, PIs are encouraged to consult the program officers above to discuss the possibility of submitting a proposal of 4 or 5 year duration.
Some AMO-related activities are supported primarily by other NSF Programs. Proposals focused on condensed matter systems should be directed to the Division of Materials Research, which contains the Condensed Matter Physics Program and the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program. Applied AMO proposals are supported by the Engineering Directorate, particularly the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic Devices Program. The Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program within the Chemistry Division supports proposals on molecules. Experimental and theoretical AMO proposals on Quantum Information Science should be directed to the Quantum Information Science (QIS) program. Proposals for large equipment can be made to the Major Research Instrumentation Program. All of these other programs coordinate the AMO aspects of their proposal portfolio closely with the AMO-E program.
Principal Investigators (PIs or co-PIs) who already have an active award or pending proposal in the Physics Division are asked to contact the cognizant Program Directors before considering submitting a proposal for another concurrent award from the AMO-E Program. ",,,,505435,nsf23615,Cleared,2017-05-01,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/atomic-molecular-optical-physics-experiment/106676,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/phy-division-physics-investigator-initiated-research-projects/nsf23-615/solicitation

Major focus areas include direct observation of new phenomena at the highest achievable energies and indirect discovery via precision measurements of known processes. The program provides support for university research at high energy accelerator facilities, development of novel instrumentation and analysis paradigms, and techniques that provide alternate pathways to discovery of new physics beyond the Standard Model.
The EPP program is organized in the following subareas (Program Elements):
High Energy Particle Physics (1221): This area supports university research focused primarily on direct discovery using the highest achievable energies.  It includes research support for the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider and studies of discovery reach at current and future collider facilities.
Precision Particle Physics (156Y): This area supports university research focused on precision measurements of known and often rare processes to discover or constrain deviations from Standard Model expectations. It includes research support for experiments at accelerator facilities, such as the LHCb experiment and neutrino experiments, and non-accelerator experiments using AMO or other techniques.
Tools for Particle Physics (157Y): This area supports university research efforts to significantly improve or transform current particle physics experimental techniques.  It includes early concept research into new particle detection technologies and development of novel data collection, processing, and analysis capabilities.  Advances in this area are expected from connections to other domains such as AMO, QIS, and AI.

The program ""Physics of Living Systems"" (PoLS) targets synergy of theoretical and experimental research exploring the most fundamental physical processes that living systems utilize to perform their functions in dynamic and diverse environments. The focus of the research proposals should be on understanding basic physical principles that underlie biological function. Proposals that use physics equipment only as a tool to study biological questions are of VERY low priority.
PoLS encourages research that emphasizes the physical principles of organization and function of living systems, including the exploration of artificial life forms and how life began. While the problems under study must be important to advancing our understanding of the living world in a quantitative way, particular emphasis will be placed on those projects in which lessons learned from the biological application also expand the intellectual range of physics. Awards cover a broad spectrum of physics approaches in biology, ranging from the physical principles and mechanisms at the single cell level such as molecular architecture and dynamics inside cells, energy metabolism, gene regulation and intracellular and intercellular communication, to collective behavior and evolution of complexity in life forms and living populations of organisms. This systems approach in physics has been very successful in understanding inanimate systems, and has the potential to bring deep understanding of the world of animated, replicating systems, through testable phenomenological theories. The program funds individual investigators, although collaborative proposals between physicists and biological researchers are welcome.

"Crosscutting Activities in Materials Research (XC)","Crosscutting Activities in Materials Research (XC) coordinates and supports crosscutting activities within the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and more broadly across NSF.
The emphasis within XC is diversity and inclusion, international cooperation, and education (including experiential learning at REU/RET Sites). Additionally, activities that broadly engage the community, such as summer schools, institutes, workshops, and conferences that do not fit within just one or two programs in the Division of Materials Research, may be supported by XC. If preparing a workshop proposal, follow the Special Guidelines for Conference Proposals outlined in the Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG). Occasionally projects crossing several programs in DMR are shifted to XC or co-funded by XC. The goal is to bring greater visibility to these projects through DMR’s XC website.
Proposals are welcome that do not fit elsewhere at NSF that are also highly relevant for the materials research and education community. Some XC activities are co-funded with other NSF units. XC does not handle traditional research proposals suitable for submission to topical or other programs in DMR. For this reason, the XC Team welcomes inquiries that include a draft of one-page NSF summary, or a shorter write-up. It is highly recommended that you contact one of the Program Directors for XC prior to submission of a full proposal exceeding $50,000.
Crosscutting Activities in Materials Research (XC) replaced the Office of Special Programs in Materials Research (OSP) in 2016.

"Connections in Quantum Information Science (CQIS)","Demands for novel computers, secure communication, and higher resolution sensors have pushed technology beyond the scaling limits of classical technologies, into the area of Quantum Information Science (QIS). Research in QIS spans many disciplines, relying on advances in physical sciences, materials science, computer science, mathematics, and engineering. Support is needed to advance this fundamental research and catalyze development of innovative technologies in QIS that will strongly benefit the nation’s continued scientific and economic health as well as its future workforce. The Connections in Quantum Information Science (CQIS) program will examine concepts and paradigms harnessing fundamental quantum properties for exploration of new scientific frontiers and development of new technologies that lie at the interface of traditional scientific disciplines. This will provide the fundamental knowledge and tools necessary to predict and control the quantum behavior of molecules, atoms, and electrons, creating entirely new material assemblies, devices, and engineering systems.
Research in QIS is currently supported through core programs residing in the six NSF Divisions participating in the CQIS program. The CQIS program is not intended to replace existing programs that support QIS-related research. Rather, the CQIS program will allow for the coordinated support of the QIS research community across various disciplines. A working group comprising representatives of all participating NSF funding units will manage the review of proposals submitted to the CQIS program. The group will ensure that proposals are reviewed by the most suitable NSF program and will coordinate co-review by more than one NSF program when appropriate.
Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS)
The CQIS program in MPS concerns the preparation and control of the quantum mechanical states of physical systems for the purposes of information transmission and manipulation. QIS includes quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum cryptography. Examples of specific activities include experimental research on physical realizations of qubits and devices to perform operations on them, development of algorithms and error-correcting codes for quantum computation, modeling of physical qubits, development of quantum communication protocols, and work in quantum complexity theory, quantum channel capacity theory, and quantum control theory.
Division of Chemistry (CHE): QIS‐related research includes both theoretical and experimental activities that specifically seek to improve our control over the distribution and dynamics of quantum states within atomic and molecular systems. Quantum state control often involves cold temperatures, ultrafast shaped or strong field laser pulses, and information feedback loops. Theoretical approaches may deal with quantum control landscapes, quantum optimal environment engineering, quantum entanglement, decoherence, and quantum phase transitions. The control over the quantum states of molecular systems leads to a better understanding of their structure and dynamics. The design, synthesis and characterization of molecular, supramolecular and nanostructures for understanding and controlling quantum phenomenon are of interest. Advances in QIS related chemistry and chemical physics also have clear implications for the development of quantum computing technology. CHE also funds proposals directly focused on quantum information and quantum computing. Concepts from QIS inform the development of novel methods in quantum chemistry.

Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods (CTMC)
Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A)
Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN)

Division of Materials Research (DMR): QIS involves the creation, maintenance and control and manipulation of coherent quantum states of matter, for potential applications of quantum informational processing, secure communication, quantum sensing, entanglement and its meaning in many-body systems etc. QIS research covers solids and liquids, surfaces, interfaces and defects, and includes: (a) quantum dots, electron spins in semiconductors and on helium, nitrogen vacancies and other spin-active color-center defects in wide-bandgap materials, superconducting Josephson junctions, materials hosting topological states, etc. as potential qubits, concepts of operation of quantum computers, and (b)nanoscaled materials (e.g., nanowires, quantum dots, and heterostructures) for single- and few-photon light emission and detection. The priority is fundamental research on the design, synthesis, and characterization of solids and liquids for quantum information science and on prediction and understanding of novel quantum phenomena of solids and liquids.

Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM)
Condensed Matter and Materials Theory (CMMT)
Condensed Matter Physics (CMP)

Division of Mathematical Sciences: The mathematical sciences, including statistics, play a central role in the study and advancement of QIS: virtually all areas across the mathematical sciences are finding extensive cutting-edge use within QIS. Mathematical sciences research in QIS includes the study of quantum algorithms, particularly those exhibiting provable exponential speedup, the extent to which quantum computers can perform efficient simulation of physical systems, error correction and fault tolerance in quantum computing, quantum control, quantum-resistant cryptography, quantum complexity theory, and the understanding of entanglement and quantum correlations. Conversely, there is tremendous promise for the development of the mathematical sciences that issues from the mathematical needs of quantum information science.

Because the NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility are integral awards for an integrated NHERI facility, this solicitation includes information about all four components of NHERI listed in NSF 14-605:  NCO, Cyberinfrastructure (CI), SimCenter, and Experimental Facility (EF).   The RAPID Facility is considered part of the EF cohort.  Under this solicitation, proposals will only be accepted for the NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility. All other proposals will be returned without review.
NHERI is the next generation of National Science Foundation (NSF) support for a natural hazards engineering research large facility, replacing the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES). NEES was established by NSF as a distributed, multi-user, national research infrastructure for earthquake engineering through a facility construction phase during 2000 - 2004, followed by operations of this infrastructure to support research, innovation, and education activities from October 2004 through September 2014.
NHERI will be a distributed, multi-user, national facility that will provide the natural hazards engineering community with access to research infrastructure (earthquake and wind engineering experimental facilities, cyberinfrastructure, computational modeling and simulation tools, and research data), coupled with education and community outreach activities. NHERI will enable research and educational advances that can contribute knowledge and innovation for the nation's civil infrastructure and communities to prevent natural hazard events from becoming societal disasters.
NHERI will consist of the following components, established through separate awards:

NCO - one award to be made under this solicitation;
SimCenter - one award to be made under this solicitation;
Experimental Facility:  RAPID Facility - one award to be made under this solicitation;
CI - one award made under NSF 14-605; and
Experimental Facilities for earthquake engineering and wind engineering research - six or seven awards made under NSF 14-605.

Under this solicitation, one cooperative agreement for the NCO, one cooperative agreement for the SimCenter, and one cooperative agreement for the RAPID Facility are anticipated to commence in early calendar 2016, with a five-year award duration. These three Awardees will not conduct research.  The primary research enabled by NHERI will be conducted by investigators supported through separate NSF awards. The NCO, SimCenter, and RAPID Facility Awardees, along with the other NHERI Awardees and the natural hazards engineering community, will work together, through Governance and Awardee activities, to establish a shared vision for NHERI, set natural hazards engineering research and education agendas and priorities, and make NHERI a value-added and productive research infrastructure.",coop,,,503259,nsf15598,"Current but no longer receiving proposals",2015-08-03,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/nheri-natural-hazards-engineering-research-infrastructure/nsf15-598,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/nheri-natural-hazards-engineering-research-infrastructure/nsf15-598/solicitation

"Facilitating Research at Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions: (RUI and ROA-PUI)","The Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) and Research Opportunity Awards (ROA) funding opportunities support research by faculty members at predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs).  RUI proposals support PUI faculty in research that engages them in their professional field(s), builds capacity for research at their home institution, and supports the integration of research and undergraduate education. ROAs similarly support PUI faculty research, but these awards typically allow faculty to work as visiting scientists at research-intensive organizations where they collaborate with other NSF-supported investigators. 

Eligible PUIs are accredited colleges and universities (including two-year community colleges) that award Associate's degrees, Bachelor's degrees, and/or Master's degrees in NSF-supported fields, but have awarded 20 or fewer Ph.D./D.Sci. degrees in all NSF-supported fields during the combined previous two academic years. 

All NSF directorates may support RUI and ROA funding activities. Funding for these awards is contained within research and education program allocations and not held as a separate allocation. RUI and ROA proposals are evaluated and funded by NSF programs in the disciplinary areas of the proposed research and are funded at their discretion. 
Prospective PIs should contact disciplinary program officers to identify specific NSF programs and to determine the feasibility and timing of RUI/ROA requests. General RUI/ROA points of contact are available through the website http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/rui_roa/contacts.jsp.  
1. Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI). An RUI proposal may be: 

A request to support an individual research project or a collaborative research project involving PUI faculty and students at their own or other institutions.
A request involving shared research instrumentation.

2.  Research Opportunity Awards (ROA). The types of ROA opportunities include: 

A supplement to an existing NSF award to support ROA activities for PUI faculty.
Requests to rebudget funds in an existing NSF award to support ROA activities for PUI faculty.
Submission of a new collaborative proposal between a PUI and another institution(s), with a ROA component as a subaward or as part of a linked collaborative proposal.","standard, continuing",,1,5518,nsf14579,Cleared,2014-07-01,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/rui-roa-pui-facilitating-research-predominantly-undergraduate/nsf14-579,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/rui-roa-pui-facilitating-research-predominantly-undergraduate/nsf14-579/solicitation
"IIS: Human-Centered Computing (HCC)","Human-Centered Computing (HCC) supports research in human-computer interaction (HCI), taken broadly, integrating knowledge across disciplines—such as the social and behavioral sciences with computer and information sciences—in order to design new computing systems to amplify diverse humans’ physical, cognitive, and social capabilities to accomplish individual and collective goals; to assess benefits, effects, and risks of computing systems; and to understand how human, technical, and contextual aspects of systems interact to shape those effects. HCC addresses novel:

Human-technology interfaces: Includes multimedia and multimodal interfaces, such as haptic, tangible, gestural, spatial, and wearable; brain-computer interfaces; intelligent and interactive user interfaces; affective computing; human state estimation involving interaction; and methods for interaction with artificial intelligence.

"Physiological and Structural Systems (PSS)","The Physiological and Structural Systems (PSS) Cluster supports research to advance understanding of whole-organism physiological mechanisms and functional morphology.  PSS supports hypothesis-driven, organismal-focused research encompassing a wide range of approaches and perspectives, spanning scales from molecular, genomic, and cellular levels to those interacting with population biology.  The Cluster encourages submission of proposals aimed at 1) identifying fundamental mechanistic principles of physiological and structural systems, 2) understanding how and why particular morphological and physiological mechanisms have evolved, and 3) how they are integrated at the level of the whole organism.  The Cluster welcomes projects involving modeling and theoretical approaches integrated with experimental approaches.  Multidisciplinary research that interfaces with biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, computer science and engineering is also encouraged.  Projects that are entirely focused at the cellular, molecular, or biochemical level, without integration at the organismal level, are not appropriate for this cluster.
The Symbiosis, Infection and Immunity (SII) Program (Program Code: 7656, Mamta Rawat, (703) 292-7265, mrawat@nsf.gov; Joanna Shisler, (703) 292-5368, jshisler@nsf.gov; Carol Fassbinder-Orth, (703) 292-8064, cfassbin@nsf.gov) supports research on processes and mechanisms mediating antagonistic or beneficial interactions within and between viruses, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes; note that plant focused research in these areas is supported by the Plant Biotic Interactions program (see below).  These relationships can include cross-and within-kingdom interactions and may scale from the level of cellular (e.g., virus-cell interactions) to organismal (e.g., host-microbiome).  The program welcomes proposals on the initiation, transmission, maintenance and dissolution of these complex associations.  Also of interest are studies of host-microbiome interactions, immunity (scaling from molecules to cells to systems), mechanisms responsible for self/non-self recognition, and microbial manipulation of immune defenses.  Comparative approaches to identify immune defense mechanisms or microbial counter-measures are encouraged.  Integrative approaches and attention to emergent properties of symbiotic interactions are also encouraged, as are all aspects and types of symbiosis within and between non-plant organisms, including mechanisms of foreign organelle acquisition and maintenance.  The program's scope ranges from fundamental research to proof-of-concept experiments in which the results of fundamental research could be used for economic or societal impacts (e.g., developing diagnostics, prophylactics and therapeutics for non-human diseases).  
The Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program (PMB) (Program Code 7658, Kathryn Dickson, (703) 292-7380, kdickson@nsf.gov; Miriam Ashley-Ross, (703) 292-4997, mashleyr@nsf.gov) supports fundamental research that addresses mechanisms of physiological processes and biomechanics in the context of the whole organism, as well as studies of physiological plasticity and adaptation.  Broad thematic areas include homeostatic control and signaling mechanisms, solute transport, gas exchange, circulation, osmoregulation, metabolism, energetics, endocrinology, reproductive physiology, muscle physiology, biomechanics, biomaterials and functional morphology.  Projects that integrate across levels of biological organization, use modeling approaches to predict physiological or biomechanical principles of organismal function, and move beyond correlational results to test mechanistic hypotheses are encouraged.  Projects focused exclusively on cellular or subcellular processes without integration at the whole organism level are not appropriate for this program. 
The Integrative Ecological Physiology Program (IEP) (Program Code: 7657, Theodore Morgan, (703) 292-7868, tmorgan@nsf.gov; Patrick Abbot, (703) 292-4740, dkabbot@nsf.gov; Keith Reinhardt, (703) 292-4854, kreinhar@nsf.gov) supports research on genetic, biochemical, morphological and physiological mechanisms underlying organismal responses to their abiotic and biotic environments.  The program seeks proposals framed in explicit ecological or evolutionary contexts that test integrative hypothesis aimed at understanding the mechanisms involved in how organisms evolve and respond to dynamic and/or stressful environments.  Proposals integrating an understanding of cause-and-effect relationships with theoretical or conceptual models of organismal responses to their environments and comparative studies across multiple organismal systems are encouraged.  Projects focused exclusively on cellular or subcellular processes without integration at the whole organism level or without ecological or evolutionary contexts are not appropriate for this program.  
The NSF-NIFA Plant Biotic Interactions Program (PBI) (Program Code: 047Y, Courtney Jahn, (703) 292-7746, cjahn@nsf.gov; Aardra Kachroo, (703) 292-7826, akachroo@nsf.gov) supports research on the processes that mediate beneficial and antagonistic interactions between plants and their viral, bacterial, oomycete, fungal, plant, and invertebrate symbionts, pathogens and pests, as well as pollen-pistil interactions and other examples of plant self/non-self recognition.  Research supported by the program spans molecular, genetic, biochemical, cellular, metabolic and whole organism perspectives.  Projects must be strongly justified in terms of fundamental biological processes and/or relevance to agriculture and may be purely fundamental or applied or include aspects of both perspectives.  Projects focused exclusively on population level and ecological processes are not supported for this program.  Important Note:  PBI is jointly managed by the NSF and USDA-NIFA.  See the PBI web page for the program summary and a link to the current solicitation: Plant Biotic Interactions | NSF - National Science Foundation.
For all IOS programs including those in the PSS Cluster, biological research on mechanisms of disease in humans, including on the etiology, diagnosis, or treatment of disease or disorder, is normally not supported.  Biological research to develop animal models of such conditions, or the development or testing of procedures for their treatment, also is not normally eligible for support. More information on NSF support of human diseases related research can be found in the Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG).",,,,504679,nsf24546,Cleared,2011-08-15,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pss-physiological-structural-systems/pd11-7658,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ios-division-integrative-organismal-systems-core-programs/nsf24-546/solicitation
"Neural Systems","The Neural Systems Cluster supports mechanistic studies in neuroscience, from structure to function in natural context, that span multiple levels of analysis, from molecular and cellular to complex behavioral aspects of organisms.   The Cluster encourages the use of comparative approaches, studies of organisms in their natural contexts, and the development of novel theoretical, computational, and transdisciplinary approaches to guide and instruct experimental design. 
Proposals should be submitted to one of the three programs below:  
The Organization Program (Program Code: 7712; Laura Borodinsky, (703) 292-4958, lborodin@nsf.gov) supports research on how the nervous system is organized along developmental, genetic, molecular, and cellular lines; explorations of developmental mechanisms; and how experiential/environmental interactions affect basic structural and functional characteristics of the nervous system.
The Activation Program (Program Code: 7713; Paul Forlano, (703) 292-46111, pforlano@nsf.gov) supports research focused on how signals from the external environment activate the nervous system, and how the nervous system integrates sensorimotor responses to trigger an action. 
The Modulation Program (Program Code: 7714; Edda Floh Thiels, (703) 292-8167, ethiels@nsf.gov; Melissa J. Coleman, (703) 292-2657, melcolem@nsf.gov) supports research focused on mechanisms mediating organism-environment interactions, including, but not limited to, synaptic, circuit, and behavioral plasticity; social and emotional regulation of behaviors; neuroendocrine and neuroimmune function; biological rhythms and other complex functions.",,,,504678,nsf24546,Cleared,2011-08-15,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/neural-systems/pd11-7714,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ios-division-integrative-organismal-systems-core-programs/nsf24-546/solicitation
"Developmental Systems","The Developmental Systems Cluster supports research aimed at understanding how interacting developmental processes give rise to the emergent properties of organisms.  Systems level approaches to understanding these processes at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels of organization, combining the use of molecular, genetic, biochemical, and physiological techniques as well as techniques from outside biology are encouraged.  The Developmental Systems Cluster is also particularly interested in understanding how emergent properties result in the development of complex phenotypes and lead to the evolution of developmental mechanisms.
Proposals should be submitted to one of the three programs below:
The Plant, Fungal and Microbial Developmental Mechanisms Program (Program Code:  1118; Anna K. Allen, akallen@nsf.gov, 703 292-8011) supports research that addresses developmental processes in plants from algae to angiosperms, microbes and fungi.
The Animal Developmental Mechanisms Program (Program Code:  1119; Anna K. Allen, akallen@nsf.gov, 703 292-8011) supports research that seeks to understand the processes that result in the complex phenotypes of animals.  Because different organisms may be more amenable to certain approaches than others, analyses of development in a wide range of different species are encouraged. Proposals directed to study the development of the Nervous System should be submitted to the Organization Program of the Neural Systems Cluster (see below).
The Evolution of Developmental Mechanisms Program (Program Code:  1080; Anna K. Allen, akallen@nsf.gov, 703 292-8011) supports research to discover the developmental processes that are shared by all organisms, and also those processes that produce diversity (phenotypic variation within a species and/or between species).  For example, the program is interested in elucidating how gene networks are modified to generate different phenotypic outcomes.  Understanding these processes will likely require inter-disciplinary and collaborative approaches using a wide range of organisms.",,,,504677,nsf24546,Cleared,2011-08-15,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/developmental-systems/pd11-1119,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ios-division-integrative-organismal-systems-core-programs/nsf24-546/solicitation
"Behavioral Systems","The Behavioral Systems Cluster supports research in the area of integrative animal behavior to understand how and why individuals and groups of animals do what they do in nature. Integrative projects that cross multiple levels of analysis to uncover connections between the development, mechanisms, adaptive value, and evolutionary history of behavior are encouraged.  The Cluster will consider both species-specific and comparative studies, as well as modeling and theoretical approaches that use animal systems to discover and explore overarching principles of the biology of behavior, and to advance a complete understanding of the integrated behavioral phenotype from genes to ecosystems.  The program recognizes that behavioral phenotypes play a key role in animal responses to pressing environmental challenges, and thus, studies of the role of animal behavior in responses to urbanization and other anthropogenic environmental change, climate change, and disease dynamics are encouraged.  Understanding human behavior per se is not a specific goal of the cluster, but the cluster will consider comparative projects involving humans.  Research submitted to this cluster should be driven by behavioral questions; projects that use behavior as an assay to answer questions about physiology, neuroscience or other areas of organismal biology are not appropriate and should go to one of the other clusters in IOS as described.  Projects where the driving question is focused on populations, communities, or ecosystems, or on processes by which evolution occurs, should go to programs in the Division of Environmental Biology (DEB).
Animal Behavior Program (Program Code: 7659; Jodie Jawor, 703 292-7887, jjawor@nsf.gov; Colette M. St. Mary, 703 292-4332, cstmary@nsf.gov; Kim Hoke, 703 292-2702, khoke@nsf.gov. The Cluster supports these broad integrative goals by supporting research proposed through the IOS core solicitation, EAGERs, RAPIDs and other special funding initiatives as well as selected seminars/conferences/workshops.  The Animal Behavior program will consider integrative projects of all sizes and timelines, including long term projects and those based on long term data.

"Science of Organizations (SoO)","Organizations -- private and public, established and entrepreneurial, designed and emergent, formal and informal, profit and nonprofit -- are critical to the well-being of nations and their citizens. They are of crucial importance for producing goods and services, creating value, providing jobs, and achieving social goals. The Science of Organizations (SoO) program funds basic research that yields a scientific evidence base for improving the design and emergence, development and deployment, and management and ultimate effectiveness of organizations of all kinds. SoO funds research that advances our fundamental understanding of how organizations develop, form and operate. Successful SoO research proposals use scientific methods to develop and refine theories, to empirically test theories and frameworks, and to develop new measures and methods. Funded research is aimed at yielding generalizable insights that are of value to the business practitioner, policy-maker and research communities. SoO welcomes any and all rigorous, scientific approaches that illuminate aspects of organizations as systems of coordination, management and governance.  In considering whether a particular project might be a candidate for consideration by SoO, please note: Intellectual perspectives may involve (but are not limited to) organizational theory, behavior, sociology or economics, business policy and strategy, communication sciences, entrepreneurship, human resource management, information sciences, managerial and organizational cognition, operations management, public administration, social or industrial psychology, and technology and innovation management. Phenomena studied may include (but are not limited to) structures, routines, effectiveness, competitiveness, innovation, dynamics, change and evolution.Levels of analysis may include (but are not limited to) organizational, cross-organizational collaborations or relationships, and institutional and can address individuals, groups or teams.Research methods may be qualitative and quantitative and may include (but are not limited to) archival analyses, surveys, simulation studies, experiments, comparative case studies, and network analyses.  Consistent with NSF merit review criteria, each SoO proposal should discuss both the intellectual merit and the potential broader impacts of the proposed research. SoO values basic research that has the potential to provide broader societal benefits. However, the majority of space in any proposal will need to be dedicated to the explication of theory, methods, and specific contribution to the evidence base about organizational effectiveness.Projects that aim to implement and subsequently evaluate particular organizational training, effectiveness or change programs, rather than to advance fundamental, generalizable knowledge, are not appropriate for SoO.Researchers who seek to conduct SoO-appropriate research in an industrial site and/or via an industry-university collaboration are invited to also look at the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaisons with Industry (GOALI) program web site.","standard, continuing","2025-09-03, 2025-09-03",,504696,pd118031,Cleared,2011-08-08,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/soo-science-organizations/pd11-8031,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/policies/pappg
"Ecosystem Science Cluster","The Ecosystem Science (ES) Cluster supports investigations of ecosystem structure and function across a diversity of spatial and temporal (including paleo) scales to advance understanding of 1) material and energy fluxes and transformations within and among ecosystems; 2) roles and relationships of ecosystem components in whole-system structure and function; 3) ecosystem dynamics, resilience, and trajectories of ecosystem change across spatial and temporal scales.
The ES Cluster supports research on ecosystems experiencing the full spectrum of human impacts, including terrestrial, freshwater, wetland/coastal, and human-dominated environments. Proposals may focus on areas such as: biogeochemical cycling and elemental budgets; primary and secondary productivity; roles of species in ecosystem functioning; stoichiometric relationships; climate-ecosystem feedbacks; impacts of climate and environmental change on ecosystems; energy and gas fluxes; ecosystem services; and landscape dynamics. Proposals may also address the cycling of non-nutrient elements, but proposals that are specifically ecotoxicological in orientation, or without an explicit link to ecosystem processes, will not be considered. Ecosystem-oriented proposals with pelagic marine, deep ocean, or Laurentian Great Lakes study sites should be submitted to the Biological Oceanography Program in the Division of Ocean Sciences, not the Ecosystem Science Cluster. Studies of the structure and dynamics of food webs are commonly co-reviewed with the Population and Community Ecology Cluster, also in the Division of Environmental Biology (DEB). Proposals that span other traditional programmatic boundaries are welcomed and may be co-reviewed with a variety of programs across the Foundation.
The ES Cluster encourages a diversity of research approaches. Projects may be based on data reuse, modeling, observational studies, and/or manipulative experiments and they may take place in field, mesocosm, computational, and laboratory settings. Proposals submitted to the ES Cluster, whether hypothesis- or discovery-driven, should have a strong theoretical or conceptual foundation. Proposals that, in whole or part, aim to develop new techniques can be supported, but only when a compelling argument exists that there is clear potential for a major advance in ecosystem science. We encourage projects that are potentially transformative -- that is, those that may change the conceptual basis of ecosystem science and have broad implications for future research, recognizing that truly transformative advances are rare.
In addition to opportunities described in the DEB core solicitation, the ES Cluster also funds proposals submitted in response to the CAREER, RCN, LTREB, MCA and OPUS solicitations, among others, that address the topics above. We also accept RAPID, EAGER, and Planning Proposals. However, these proposals require approval from an ES program officer prior to submission. Approval is obtained by first submitting a Concept Outline. We encourage submission of the Concept Outline through NSF’s new Program Suitability and Proposal Concept Tool (ProSPCT). For conference proposals and requests for supplementary funding, investigators should contact an ES program officer prior to preparing a submission. The Cluster welcomes inquiries on any proposal type prior to submission.",,,,503663,nsf24543,Cleared,2011-06-15,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ecosystem-science-cluster/pd11-7381,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/deb-division-environmental-biology/nsf24-543/solicitation
"Evolutionary Processes Cluster","The Evolutionary Processes Cluster supports research that makes inference about micro- and macroevolutionary processes and their consequences, over any addressable spatial or temporal scale. The cluster addresses evolutionary processes at multiple levels including: 1) the genome and epigenome; 2) the phenotype; 3) intraspecific evolution and adaptation, including life history evolution; 4) the evolutionary genetics and evolutionary ecology of lineage divergence and speciation; 5) interspecific interactions and evolution (e.g., hybridization; parasitism; etc.); and 6) biogeography. We encourage both empirical and theoretical approaches. Projects should address one or more fundamental questions of broad significance that will substantially advance science.
Appropriate topics of investigation include (but are not limited to) population and quantitative genetic examination of the processes responsible for phenotypic and genotypic evolution; ecological and/or genomic processes maintaining genetic variation; how genetic architecture shapes and is shaped by evolutionary processes; life-history evolution; the evolutionary dynamics of population diversification (including phylogeography and speciation); the evolution and coevolution of species interactions; the dynamics of natural and sexual selection; and reciprocal interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes. The Cluster also welcomes proposals that cross programmatic boundaries at NSF, provided there is a strong component of inference about evolutionary processes. The Program will work with other NSF Programs to facilitate interdisciplinary approaches.
The Cluster funds proposals submitted in response to the CAREER, RCN, LTREB, MCA and OPUS solicitations. The Cluster also funds Conference proposals, requests for supplemental funding, and RAPID, EAGER, or RAISE applications. These should be submitted only after consulting a Program Officer, following the standard guidelines directly in response to the PAPPG.
NOTE: Other programs in the Biological Sciences Directorate support research on evolutionary patterns and processes. The following guidelines may help you find the most appropriate program for your research interests. Proposals focused on phylogenetic diversification, and the origins and maintenance of biodiversity at the clade and higher levels should be directed to the Systematics and Biodiversity Sciences Cluster in DEB. Proposals addressing molecular genetic mechanisms or the structure, maintenance, expression, transfer, and stability of genetic information in DNA, RNA, chromosomes, and proteins and how those processes are regulated and evolve are considered by the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster (Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences). Proposals addressing the genetic bases of traits, or among-species comparisons of behavioral, physiological or developmental systems, that look at outcomes of evolution alone or in addition to the evolutionary processes that gave rise to those outcomes, are covered by programs in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems. Program Officers stand ready to answer more specific questions about the best program, or combination of programs, for your particular research plans.",,,,503664,nsf24543,Cleared,2011-06-15,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/evolutionary-processes-cluster/pd11-7378,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/deb-division-environmental-biology/nsf24-543/solicitation
"Population and Community Ecology Cluster","The Population and Community Ecology (PCE) Cluster supports research that advances the conceptual or theoretical understanding of population ecology, species interactions and community dynamics in terrestrial, wetland, and freshwater habitats.  Topics supported include population dynamics of individual species, demography, and fundamental ecological interactions affecting populations, communities, and their environments.  Themes include but are not limited to: population regulation; food-web structure and trophic dynamics; competition, predation, mutualism and parasitism; mechanisms of coexistence and the maintenance of species diversity; community assembly; paleoecology; landscape ecology; conservation and restoration biology; behavioral ecology; and macroecology. 
We encourage projects that integrate theoretical, modeling, and empirical approaches, or that promote synthesis across spatial and temporal scales.  The cluster seeks to fund projects that are transformative -- that is, those that will change the conceptual bases of population and community ecology and have broad implications for future research.  Proposals that develop research questions within the context of existing theory, consider alternate mechanisms, and design critical tests to distinguish among mechanisms are particularly encouraged, as are those that use contemporary approaches to develop new paradigms.  Inter- and multi-disciplinary proposals that cross traditional programmatic boundaries are welcomed; such proposals may be co-reviewed with other programs in DEB, in other Divisions in the Biology Directorate, or in other Directorates. 
The cluster also funds proposals submitted in response to the CAREER, RCN, RUI, LTREB, MCA and OPUS solicitations. Requests for support of conferences and workshops, supplemental funding to existing awards, and for RAPIDs or EAGERs, should be submitted to the PAPPG (Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide), following its standard guidelines.  For proposals submitted to the PAPPG, prior correspondence with a PCE Program Officer is strongly encouraged.
Studies that focus on the ecology of marine organisms should be directed to the Biological Oceanography Program in the Division of Ocean Sciences. Applied research (e.g., ecotoxicology) and research focused on human disease or health are not supported.

"Systematics and Biodiversity Science Cluster (SBS)","Supports research that advances understanding of the diversity, systematics, distribution, and evolutionary history of extant and extinct organisms. The Systematics and Biodiversity Science (SBS) cluster Program Description is valid for all proposals submitted in response to the Division of Environmental Biology core solicitation.
The SBS cluster supports research that advances our understanding of diversity, systematics, and evolutionary history of extant or extinct organisms in natural systems. This research may encompass a broad range of topics and approaches ranging from phylogenetic comparative studies to biogeographic and exploratory biodiversity studies. SBS-supported research addresses fundamental questions in biology such as: What kinds of organisms exist (or existed)? How are they related? How can phylogenetic history shed light on evolutionary patterns and processes in nature? Example topics include: expeditionary biodiversity research and discovery; identification and classification of extinct and/or extant organisms; comparative analysis of morphological, physiological, developmental, ecological, behavioral and/or molecular traits; and development of systematics theory and/or new methods of phylogenetic analysis.
All proposals that include new collections should provide documented plans for fieldwork coordination and/or permitting, as well as a Data Management and Sharing Plan that provides details on the collection metadata, vouchering, preparation, long-term storage, and availability of specimens.
Special Categories for SBS Cluster:
The Systematics and Biodiversity Science cluster core program accepts two special categories of proposals: 1) Advancing Revisionary Taxonomy and Systematics (ARTS), and 2) Poorly Sampled and Unknown Taxa (PurSUiT).
Advancing Revisionary Taxonomy and Systematics (ARTS)
Revisionary taxonomic research is fundamental to understanding planetary biodiversity and providing a conceptual framework for all biological and related applied sciences. However, the description and classification of Earth’s extant and extinct biodiversity has not kept pace with its rate of discovery. The SBS cluster encourages the submission of proposals that use innovative approaches to conduct and accelerate taxonomic research. ARTS proposals must include plans for characterization, description, and naming at the species level in monographic or equivalent forms. Proposals also must include a detailed training plan for researchers and students that will prepare future generations of broadly trained taxonomists. Projects that leverage recent technological and cyberinfrastructure developments and focus on organisms that are taxonomically understudied, or for which taxonomic expertise is limited or vanishing, are also encouraged. The need and urgency of the revisionary synthesis for a particular group of organisms must be justified.
Poorly Sampled and Unknown Taxa (PurSUiT)
The vast unknown diversity of life on Earth has the potential to lead to novel discoveries, to identify new research directions, and to play a critical role in biodiversity and sustainability efforts. The SBS cluster encourages the submission of proposals that aim to advance the discovery, identification, description, and cataloguing of the world's least known extant and/or extinct biodiversity. Projects may be expeditionary and/or exploratory. Priority will be given to innovative projects that fill significant gaps in biodiversity knowledge related to understudied taxonomic groups, and that leverage technological advances to integrate compelling biodiversity discovery questions in an evolutionary, phylogenetic, and/or taxonomic framework. Proposals must include a detailed training plan that will enhance organismal, phylogenomic, bioinformatics, phenotypic, and/or analytical expertise to help address these significant gaps in biodiversity knowledge.
Additional Proposal Types:
The SBS cluster also funds proposals submitted in response to the CAREER, Research Coordination Networks (RCN), Mid-Career Advancement (MCA) and Opportunities for Promoting Understanding Through Synthesis (OPUS) solicitations. Conference proposals, requests for supplemental funding, RAPID, EAGER and RAISE proposals are also accepted, all of which should be submitted directly to the NSF Proposals & Award Policy & Procedures Guide (PAPPG), following the standard guidelines therein.
NOTE: Research on biodiversity and evolution is supported in various ways across the Biological Sciences Directorate, and the Systematics and Biodiversity Science Cluster frequently co-reviews projects with other clusters or programs. Research projects that might be more appropriately targeted to programs other than Systematics and Biodiversity Science include: demography and evolutionary processes below the species level; genomic or functional studies without a phylogenetic or comparative focus (Evolutionary Processes); functional diversity, species interactions in an ecological context, and community dynamics (Population and Community Ecology); and ecosystem structure and function (Ecosystem Science). For proposals in these areas, please consult the Directorate for Biological Sciences website to identify programs whose priorities seem to be a good match for your research. You are always encouraged to contact a program officer for guidance about the most appropriate program for your particular research. ",,,,503666,nsf24543,Cleared,2011-06-15,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/sbs-systematics-biodiversity-science-cluster/pd11-1198,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/deb-division-environmental-biology/nsf24-543/solicitation

"CNS: Computer Systems Research (CSR)","Computer systems support a broad range of applications and technologies that seamlessly integrate with human users. While many key building blocks of computer systems are today commercial technologies, the challenge ahead is to envision new technologies, as well as to combine existing technologies, software, and sensing systems into the computer systems of the future that will span wearable computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), smart environments, intelligent transportation systems, personalized healthcare, data intensive and distributed systems, energy-efficient and sustainable computing, emerging workloads, digital twins, AI-enabled, Post-Moore and quantum computing models and architectures and beyond. Such computer systems will require new, innovative, and visionary approaches to hardware, wired and wireless communications, and consideration of human-computer interactions, that are limited only by the imagination. These systems will need to be reliable in the presence of unreliable components, networking, and configurations, adaptive to changing environments and computer usage scenarios, attentive to unintended consequences of their operations, capable of supporting high-throughput applications and large-scale data storage and processing, maintain privacy and security, and able to meet performance and energy objectives for applications ranging from very low-power embedded systems to large high-performance computing systems. Clean-slate approaches considering security, privacy and energy-efficiency by design are particularly welcome.
The Computer Systems Research (CSR) program supports transformative scientific and engineering research leading to the development of the next generation of highly performant, heterogeneous, energy-efficient, environmentally sustainable, secure and privacy-preserving computer systems. The scope of the program includes embedded and multicore systems and accelerators; mobile and extensible distributed systems; cloud and data-intensive processing systems; and memory, storage, and file systems. The program seeks innovative research proposals that will advance the reliability, performance, power, energy-efficiency, security and privacy, scalability, and sustainability of computer systems.
Note: Some projects might be appropriate for joint consideration by NeTS and CSR and may be submitted to either program for joint review.

NeTS support research in wired and wireless technologies including terabit Ethernet, optical, radio, and acoustic visible light-based communication, and quantum. NeTS seeks novel frameworks, architectures, protocols, methodologies and experimental approaches including measurement and tools for the design and analysis, development, operation, and management of robust and highly dependable networks, including autonomous networks in which the need for human intervention is minimal. The program also seeks projects that enable energy-efficient operation with low control and communication overhead for networks.
Note: Some projects might be appropriate for joint consideration by NeTS and CSR and may be submitted to either program for joint review.
 
What is NOT within scope for the NeTS program
The following are typically not supported by the NeTS program and unless discussed in advance with a NeTS program director before submission, will be considered for Return Without Review (RWR):

Research that resides primarily at the device or application layer or are highly context-specific;


Intelligent transportation systems unless the focus of the research is on an enabling communication network;


Social networks unless the research has a direct connection to communication networking research;


Network science that does not specifically focus on an engineered communication networks; and


Projects, including those with sensors, that do not explicitly focus on networking problems and challenges. 

 
Wired Networking 
As noted above wired networking focuses on such networks as IoT, home, edge, enterprise, data center, cloud, and Internet or Internet-scale networks including wide-area, metropolitan-area, as well as back-haul and wired access networks.  Projects may explore fundamental principles and create innovative networking technologies, protocols, and systems that define the future or—more realistically—harness current and emerging technologies, trends, and applications. They may produce practical abstractions, techniques, tools, artifacts, or datasets that address/enhance both general and functional requirements. Network systems proposals are expected to demonstrate a clear understanding of what each component does and how it interfaces with the rest of the system and the environment.
Projects appropriate for wired part of NeTS are not limited to the following suggested topics. Rather researchers are also encouraged to address other pressing and challenging networking areas of research. NeTS invites proposals in the broad area of wired networks. For example, the program:

Encourages research addressing networking challenges that come with emerging technologies including rethinking the protocol stack where necessary, new networking paradigms, protocols, and required new hardware approaches for networks enabled and demanded, for example, by optical networking,  quantum computing and communication, and terabit to petabit Ethernet.


Invites proposals that address research relevant to commercial trends that are expected to impact future networks such as cloud repatriation--where companies are moving their cloud service back in-house and require networks that are secure-by-construction, cost-efficient and agile. Another trend is multi-cloud networking which, for example, may leverage understanding and principles of the massive scale and distributed nature of the Internet in this context.


Supports projects that address on-going trends such as in-networking computing and storage, networking in disaggregated system, and programmable networks.  There is also a need to scale data centers by a factor of ten or more and explore and mitigate the resulting networking roadblocks in hardware, software, and functionality through integrated designs, for example, in switches, memory, and protocols.


Includes projects that focus on application-aware networking, such as video and data streaming including for big science and artificial reality/virtual reality (AR/VR).  Projects might also include networking where constrained physical infrastructure, applications and security inform networking solutions such as in small Internet of things (IoT) or those which leverage knowledge from understanding the global Internet to improve and make more resilient large-scale networked applications.


Supports networking projects that focus on systems with inherent built-in security such as, for example, networking for critical-infrastructure SCADAs (supervised control and data acquisition) where verifiable networking is crucial as is security and domain knowledge of the system requiring the SCADA.


Welcomes new approaches for core networking functionality such as network management involving, for example, monitoring, measurement, and traffic engineering as well as improving network performance--including latency and quality of service (QoS),  increasing network resilience and energy efficiency.


Accepts the development and application of novel approaches, such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), applied to networking problems.


Encourages new approaches to creating dependable autonomous or self-driving networks, for example by replacing traditional methods with automated processes, especially those based on AI, ML and emerging methods as well as the use of network verification. Projects may address full-stack explainability including approaches where the provenance of every data/control flow dependency is well known.


Accepts projects focusing on end-to-end services that span edge to core to cloud, potentially integrating and optimizing across wired and wireless technologies and networks.  

Wireless Networking
NeTS invites proposals in the broad area of wireless communications networks.  These networks include edge, cellular and hybrid, mobile, vehicular, mesh, underwater, machine to machine, satellite, and IoT wireless networks.  The program:

Seeks systems research on novel architectures, protocols, and tools for the design, deployment, operation, and management of robust wireless networks;


Welcomes theoretical and artificial intelligence-based approaches for design and analysis of wireless communications networks, including establishment of performance limits and characterization of achievable trade-offs;


Supports holistic approaches to support efficient and dynamic resource allocation, usage, and sharing; seeks efficient and dynamic approaches to interference management and the coexistence of multiple co-located networks, potentially including different radio technologies and network protocols;


Funds research on wireless networks that utilize a multitude of emerging physical layer technologies. Examples include massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antenna systems, mmWave and higher bands networking, intelligent surfaces, dynamic spectrum access systems, free-space optics and visible light communications, high-bandwidth airborne and underwater communication platforms, and ultra-low latency wireless links; 


Seeks research on innovative higher-layer services that can be enabled by wireless communications, such as wireless localization, virtualization, mobile sensing, and spectrum measurement; and


Welcomes proposals that can address key questions relating to high throughput, low latency, pervasive connectivity, energy-efficiency information availability, reliability, resilience, and security, as well as the ability of the wireless network to satisfy the stringent requirements of emerging applications, such as AR/VR.

 
Proposers should present a solid plan for verification and validation of the proposed techniques. NeTS encourages over-the-air experimentation using NSF-funded infrastructure platforms when applicable.
NeTS and Closely-Related Programs: Projects that focus exclusively or primarily on cybersecurity threats and countermeasures may be a better fit for the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program. Projects focused primarily on design or enhancement of sensing and control systems that interact with the physical world may be a better fit for the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) program.

"CCF: Software and Hardware Foundations (SHF)","The Software and Hardware Foundations (SHF) program supports potentially transformative research in the design, verification, operation, utilization, and evaluation of computer software and hardware through novel approaches, robust theories, high-leverage tools, and lasting principles. Such advances may involve formal methods, languages, logics, novel software and/or hardware artifacts, or algorithms to enable new or enhanced functionality, verification, usability, and scale.
The SHF program supports all aspects of the science and engineering of software, seeking transformative ideas that reformulate the relationships between requirements, design and evolution of software, and software-intensive systems. SHF supports research projects focusing on program analysis and synthesis, compositionality, verifiability and adaptability of software, as well as research on software analysis and testing techniques for all stages of the software life cycle. SHF also seeks research to increase the automation of software engineering capabilities to attain significant advances in quality and sustainability of software, which may require new representations and processes. Empirical research that increases understanding of software and software creation is also in scope. New ideas and visions are additionally sought related to emerging considerations in the fitness of software, including correctness in the face of environmental variability, policy compliance, and the like. SHF aims to support software engineering research for emerging disciplines and domains, such as machine learning-based applications and systems, cyber-physical and autonomous systems, biocomputing systems, health-care technology, security, and the Internet of Things. Proposals in these areas are in scope, provided they emphasize software engineering research concerns such as requirements and design, software architectures, model-driven software engineering, programmability, software quality assurance, software productivity enhancement, and software sustainability.
The SHF program supports the entire range of programming languages research, from foundations to design to implementation. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, language semantics and type theory, design and implementation of advanced languages and language features, compilers and runtime systems for advanced languages and architectures, abstract interpretation, program analysis and optimization, and design and implementation of domain-specific languages. Research in programming languages, program logics, and models that go beyond mainstream practice, such as those for concurrent, functional, logic, and probabilistic programs, is particularly encouraged. Foundational research that exposes novel synergies between programming languages and other areas of computing, such as distributed and networked systems and machine learning, is also encouraged.
The SHF program supports fundamental research on formal and semi-formal methods for the specification, modeling, development, and verification of software and hardware systems. This includes, but is not limited to, semantics, logics, abstraction, and compositional, refinement-based, and probabilistic methods for the modeling and validation of systems involving discrete and continuous behavior. The program seeks proposals that enhance the applicability, usability, and efficiency of techniques such as abstract interpretation, model checking, theorem proving, automated decision procedures, and constraint solving. SHF supports foundations, algorithms, and tools for software and hardware synthesis. The program also supports development of new formal techniques for emerging areas such as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, and policy and regulatory compliance.
The SHF program supports fundamental research in all topics in design automation, including but not limited to logical, physical, behavioral, and high-level synthesis methods, testing, and verification; pre- and post-silicon validation; and design methodologies for scalable, low-power, and energy-efficient circuits and systems in silicon technologies. SHF also seeks research on design automation for emerging non-silicon technologies, possibly using non-charge-based state vectors (e.g., electron-spin, micro-electromechanical systems, optics, or phase state of materials), that may have the potential to take computation beyond Moore's Law. Analog circuits as well as ultra-high-frequency communication circuits and systems specifically aimed towards this latter goal are also within scope.
The SHF program supports research on hardware architectures that are inspired by artificial intelligence and machine learning, and that make synergistic use of materials and device technologies, along with their efficient implementations. Hardware experimentation of both model-based or model-free novel machine learning algorithms, e.g., those inspired by information theory and/or statistical mechanics, as examples of computing models inspired by physics are in scope as well.
The SHF program supports foundational research in high-performance computing (HPC) that is aware of, driven by, and inspired by applications and is also informed by platform heterogeneity and architecture concerns. SHF seeks novel research on enabling technologies and tools to balance and optimize performance goals including scalability, power, productivity, repeatability, and validity. SHF encourages software and hardware co-development and co-design to exploit parallelism and concurrency at scale to satisfy energy, performance, reliability, and programmability requirements. A radical examination of the whole hardware/software computing stack from applications to algorithms, to system software, to architectures, to technologies, is encouraged to lay the foundation for next-generation HPC systems.
The SHF program supports foundational research in computer architecture and computer hardware system design, including but not limited to specialization, heterogeneity, energy efficiency, approximation, scalability, parallelism and concurrency, inter-component communication, performance, reliability, and novel computing paradigms. The program supports fundamental and transformative research in processors, accelerators, interconnects, memory, and storage architectures.

The CIF program also supports foundational research in networked systems, such as network information theory and cross-layer design in wireless systems. Examples include secure communication, sensor networks, and other scenarios that feature massive data aggregation from distributed sensing.
In addition to the traditional topics that have fueled the information revolution, there is continued interest within the CIF program in new paradigms. These include but are not limited to statistical learning and inference, signal processing on graphs and networks, multi-terminal communication problems, information-theoretic security, geometric methods in signal processing and machine learning, computational imaging, and communication-theoretic challenges associated with emerging communication technology. In the machine learning area in particular, CIF seeks to encourage research promoting paradigms based on foundational principles, rooted in information theory and statistical inference, that advance the explainability and generalizability of machine learning. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, scalability, performance guarantees, and fundamental limits, alongside fairness and robustness of machine learning techniques.
At its core, CIF is interested in the mathematical exploration of novel problem formulations rooted in the aforementioned application domains.",,,,503300,nsf24589,Cleared,2008-07-30,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cif-ccf-communications-information-foundations/103509,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/computer-information-science-engineering-core-programs/nsf24-589/solicitation
"CCF: Algorithmic Foundations (AF)","The Algorithmic Foundations (AF) program supports potentially transformative projects in the theory of algorithms. Projects should be characterized by algorithmic innovation accompanied by rigorous analysis. Of interest is research on algorithms for problems that are central to computer science and engineering, as well as new techniques for the rigorous analysis of algorithms and computational complexity. AF supports theoretical research that bounds the intrinsic difficulty of problems to determine measures of complexity in formal models of computation, classical or new. The goal is to understand the fundamental limits of resource-bounded computation and to obtain efficient algorithms operating within those limits. Research on resources other than the traditional time and space measures, such as communication and energy, is also encouraged, as is research on tradeoffs between resource use and solution quality, such as running time vs. approximation error. Rigorous analysis of properties of algorithms relating to fairness, ethics, accountability, transparency, and privacy is also in scope. In addition to the traditional sequential-computing paradigm, AF supports research on the design and analysis of novel algorithms in parallel and distributed models, as well as computational models and algorithms that capture essential aspects of computing over massive data sets.
New techniques for the design and analysis of algorithms and analysis of problem complexity in areas such as optimization, cryptography, computational geometry, game theory and economics, social networks, machine learning, and numeric, symbolic, and algebraic computing are within the scope of this program. The program also supports research in algorithms needed in applied areas of research, including algorithmic research on problems arising in other areas of research on computing. While relevance to application areas is important and collaboration with researchers in these areas is encouraged, research funded by this program must advance the theoretical study of algorithms. When accompanying rigorous analysis of computational resource requirements and/or algorithmic performance measures, implementation efforts and empirical evaluation are considered strong broader impacts. Letters of collaboration from applied researchers are encouraged.
Emerging topics such as quantum computing and biological models of computation are now addressed in the Foundations of Emerging Technologies (FET) program. However, projects in these areas focused on foundational issues of algorithms and complexity in these topics, as described above, can also be considered by the AF program.",,,,503299,nsf24589,Cleared,2008-07-30,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/af-ccf-algorithmic-foundations/103508,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/computer-information-science-engineering-core-programs/nsf24-589/solicitation

"Plasma Physics","Proposals in the area of plasma physics submitted to the Division of Physics that are not governed by another solicitation (such as CAREER), should be submitted to the Division-wide solicitation: Division of Physics: Investigator-Initiated Research Projects.
The Plasma Physics program participates in multiple NSF meta-programs such as the ECosytem for Leading Innovation in Plasma Science and Engineering (ECLIPSE), Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (WoU-MMA), and Computational and Data-enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E). Topically appropriate proposals may also be submitted to the Plasma Physics program in response to NSF Dear Colleague Letters such as Critical Aspects of Sustainability (CAS): Innovative Solutions to Sustainable Chemistry (CAS-SC).
When permitted under an MOU between NSF and another funding agency or private foundation, NSF may share information from proposals submitted to this solicitation for consideration of joint funding, and may invite employees of such organizations to attend merit review panels as observers. MOUs of relevance to the Plasma Physics program presently exist with the Department of Energy/Office of Science, National Nuclear Security Administration, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation, the Czech Science Foundation, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation), and the Swiss National Science Foundation.
Plasma Physics is a study of matter and physical systems whose intrinsic properties are governed by collective interactions of large ensembles of free charged particles. 99.9% of the visible Universe is thought to consist of plasmas. The underlying physics of the collective behavior in plasmas has applications to space physics and astrophysics, materials science, applied mathematics, fusion science, accelerator science, and many branches of engineering.
The Plasma Physics program supports research that can be categorized by several broad, sometimes overlapping, sub-areas of the discipline, including: magnetized plasmas in the laboratory, space, and astrophysical environments; high energy density plasmas; low temperature plasmas; dusty, ultra-cold, and otherwise strongly coupled plasmas; non-neutral plasmas; and intense field-matter interaction in plasmas. The focus of the Plasma Physics program is to generate an understanding of the fundamental principles governing the physical behavior of a plasma via collective interactions of large ensembles of free charged particles, as well as to improve the basic understanding of the plasma state as needed for other areas of science and engineering.
Principal Investigators (PIs) are encouraged to consider including specific efforts to increase diversity of the plasma physics community and broaden participation of under-represented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) as Broader Impacts of proposed work. Development of new undergraduate and graduate plasma physics curricula, or curricula enhancement to include plasma physics topics in other courses, at institutions lacking such coursework is similarly encouraged.
NSF recognizes that some research projects within this Program may require more than three years to realize demonstrable research outcomes. For such projects, PIs are encouraged to consult the above Program Director to discuss the possibility of submitting a proposal of 4- or 5-year duration.
Some Plasma Physics-related activities are supported primarily by other NSF Programs. Proposals focused on the physical properties of individual or a small number of atoms or molecules, or optical physics, should be directed to the Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics Program within the Division of Physics. Proposals focused on understanding astrophysical systems should be directed to the Division of Astronomical Sciences. Proposals focused on understanding the Geospace environment or the Sun-Earth interactions should be directed to an appropriate program within the Geospace Section of the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences. Proposals focused on development of new materials using plasmas should be directed to an appropriate program in the Division of Materials Research. Proposals focused on plasma-assisted manufacturing should be directed to the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation. Finally, proposals focused on use of plasmas for environmental and reaction engineering, environmental sustainability, combustion systems, or engineering of biomedical systems should be directed to an appropriate program within the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport systems.","standard, continuing","2025-11-17, 2025-11-17",,503252,pd231242,Cleared,2008-05-20,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/plasma-physics/pd23-1242,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/policies/pappg
"Chemistry Research Experiences for Undergraduates Sites (CHE REU Sites)","The Division of Chemistry's REU program is part of an NSF-wide program under a single solicitation administered individually by each NSF Directorate and/or Division. In the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, each Division administers the program. An REU Site should provide research opportunities with a coherent intellectual theme and may be based in a single discipline or academic department or be interdisciplinary and multi-departmental.
The NSF-wide Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) solicitation governs the overall competition. The following clarifications/explanations are specifically for REU Site proposals submitted to the Division of Chemistry.

Three years is typically the maximum project duration for CHE REU sites. Longer durations may be considered, but discussion with the cognizant Program Officer prior to submission is encouraged.
Usually, at least 80% of CHE REU participants come from outside the host institution.
CHE REU sites usually host 10 students per year, and seldom fewer than 8 or more than 12. If the planned site falls outside this range, discussion with the cognizant Program Officer is encouraged prior to submission of the proposal.
A typical budget in the CHE REU program does not fund more than 1 month of summer salary per year for Program Management. Sites may distribute this as needed to the PI, co-PI, research mentors, and other student- or program-assistants. Evaluation costs are considered to be separate from Program Management.
CHE REU site budgets tend to fall under $1,550 per student per week. Budgets in excess of this may be justified for extraordinary circumstances such as international sites, support for student cohorts with unusual needs, or dispersed sites, but discussion with the cognizant Program Officer prior to submission is encouraged.

Interested PIs are advised to explore the Online Directory of CHE REU Sites to determine the scope and breadth of fields funded under our program.
REU Supplements may be requested for ongoing NSF-funded research projects or may be included as a component of proposals for new or renewal NSF grants or cooperative agreements. 
Undergraduate student participants in either Sites or Supplements must be citizens or permanent residents of the United States or its possessions. 
Students may not apply to NSF to participate in REU activities. Students apply directly to REU Sites and should consult the directory of active REU Sites on the Web at https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=5048.
NOTE: All CHE REU Site applicants should submit their proposals to the NSF-wide REU solicitation and choose ""CHE - MPS/CHE - Undergraduate Programs in Chemistry"" (Directorate: Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences [MPS]; Division: Division of Chemistry [CHE]) as the appropriate Unit of Consideration
For more detailed information on the NSF-wide REU program, please see the REU program solicitation: NSF 23-601.

Sociology,"The Sociology Program supports basic research on all forms of human social organization — societies, institutions, groups and demography — and processes of individual and institutional change. The program encourages theoretically focused empirical investigations aimed at improving the explanation of fundamental social processes. This includes research on organizations and organizational behavior, population dynamics, social movements, social groups, labor force participation, stratification and mobility, family, social networks, socialization, gender, race and the sociology of science and technology. The program supports both original data collection and secondary data analysis that use the full range of quantitative and qualitative methodological tools. Theoretically grounded projects that offer methodological innovations and improvements for data collection and analysis are also welcomed. 
Principal Investigators should select PD 98-1331 in the program announcement/solicitation block on the proposal cover sheet for submission of regular research projects to the sociology program. Projects are evaluated using the two foundation-wide criteria, intellectual merit and broader impacts. In assessing the intellectual merit of proposed research, four components are key to securing support from the Sociology Program: (1) the issues investigated must be theoretically grounded; (2) the research should be based on empirical observation or be subject to empirical validation or illustration; (3) the research design must be appropriate to the questions asked; and (4) the proposed research must advance our understanding of social processes, structures and methods.
NSF also offers a number of specialized funding opportunities through its crosscutting and cross-directorate activities; some of the sociology-related opportunities are listed below.

"Perception, Action & Cognition (PAC)","The aim of the PAC program is to support empirically grounded, theoretically engaged and methodologically sophisticated research in a wide range of topic areas related to human perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes and their interactions. The PAC program welcomes a wide range of perspectives and a variety of methodologies (including computational modeling if the goal is to expand explanatory theories of human perception, action, or cognition). PAC strongly encourages proposals that examine human behavior in realistic (or real-world) scenarios and that include varied subject population. It is expected that knowledge gained from PAC-supported projects will have a clear and direct path towards benefitting society. PAC is open to co-review of proposals submitted to other programs both within the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences Directorate and across other directorates.
Note: Proposals may be returned without review if the primary goal of the research is to understand (1) structure/function mappings between PAC processes and neural activity; (2) clinical populations per se; or (3) behavior of non-human animals without a clear and direct impact on our understanding of human perception, action or cognition. Before submitting a proposal, investigators are encouraged to email sbe-pac@nsf.gov with a one-page summary of the proposed research (modeled after the Project Summary page of a standard proposal and including a description of both Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts) in order to confirm appropriateness of the work for the PAC program.
PIs are strongly encouraged to submit the Single Copy Document titled “List of Suggested Reviewers” with their full proposal. Sharing of data and other materials is an expectation for funded research. Please consult the NSF Dear Colleague Letter: Effective Practices for Data for more details.
Interested in talking with a program director? Send a one-page description of the proposed research to sbe-pac@nsf.gov.","standard, continuing","2025-08-01, 2025-08-01",,5686,pd097252,Cleared,2002-09-30,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pac-perception-action-cognition/pd09-7252,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/policies/pappg
"Social Psychology","The Social Psychology Program at NSF supports theoretically focused empirical investigations that advance fundamental social psychological explanations of human behavior, attitudes, and experience.
 
Synopsis
The Social Psychology Program invites research and infrastructure proposals that advance knowledge of how human behavior is influenced by macro- and micro-level social forces, including how thought, motivation, emotion, neural, and physiological processes explain ways of thinking about and relating to self and others.
Proposed research should carry strong potential for groundbreaking discoveries about the power of social dynamics to shape peoples’ attitudes, behavior, and experience. Basic research that connects to emerging and ongoing global challenges is especially encouraged.

 
Proposals that develop new theories or methods are highly encouraged.
Proposals involving non-human animals are considered only if the research offers clear and direct contributions to understanding human social behavior.
Note: Proposals may be returned without review if the primary goal of the research is to improve clinical practice as its primary outcome, or contains disease-related goals, including work on the etiology, diagnosis or treatment of physical or mental illness or disease, medical abnormality, or clinical interventions.
In assessing intellectual merit, the Social Psychology Program places highest priority on research that is theoretically grounded, based on empirical observation and validation, and with designs appropriate to the questions asked (including but not limited to experiments, naturalistic observations, field studies, longitudinal analyses, and computational modeling).
In assessing broader impacts, the Social Psychology Program places highest priority on proposals that offer strong potential to benefit society, strengthen national security interests, improve the quality of life, build STEM talent, enhance infrastructure for research and education, increase public engagement with science, and include a proactive plan for sharing the results with a wide variety of audiences. PIs are encouraged to review the NSF resources on broader impact.
The Social Psychology Program expects the methods, measures and data that result from NSF support to be openly shared with other researchers and the public. For further guidance proposers should consult  Data Management for NSF SBE Directorate Proposals and Awards. The Data Management and Sharing Plan (DMSP) should articulate how the proposed research will engage with best practices of open science. Researchers are expected to engage in open science practices and deviations from that should be well-justified.
The Social Psychology Program accepts regular research proposals, including Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) proposals, proposals for research in undergraduate institutions (RUI), rapid response research proposals (RAPID) and early-concept grants for exploratory research (EAGER). The program also accepts small conference proposals for events (including workshops) being planned one year or more after submission. The Social Psychology Program does not accept proposals for doctoral dissertation improvement awards or mid-career advancement (MCA) awards.
Principal Investigators should select PD 22-1332 in the program announcement/solicitation block on the proposal cover sheet for submission of regular research projects to the Social Psychology program. Interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and convergent research approaches are encouraged, and PIs are encouraged to identify possible other programs for co-review. PIs are strongly encouraged to submit the Single Copy Document titled “List of Suggested Reviewers” with their full proposal.
Investigators are encouraged to contact a Social Psychology program director before submitting a proposal to confirm its fit with the scope and priorities of the Social Psychology Program. Such contact is most productive when a one-page (maximum) summary of the planned proposal is sent ahead of a meeting.  This summary should include a description of the proposed intellectual merit and broader impacts, as well as an additional page of references cited.
The Social Psychology program is always interested in identifying new reviewers. Potential reviewers should have a Ph.D. in psychology or related field and have a demonstrated area of basic research expertise relevant to social psychology. Individuals interested in reviewing for the program should complete a short survey to indicate their area of expertise and contact information.

"National Facilities","The National Facilities program supports the operation of national user facilities: National Facilities are research facilities with specialized instrumentation available to the scientific research community in general and the materials research community in particular. These facilities provide unique research capabilities that can be located at only a few highly specialized laboratories in the Nation. They provide open user service for scientists and engineers from a broad range of disciplines including biology, chemistry, geosciences, materials research. and physics.  They include facilities and resources for research using high magnetic fields, ultraviolet and x-ray synchrotron radiation, neutron scattering, and nanofabrication. They serve as science and technology-related resources and experiences for students. They conduct student and teacher education, general public awareness activities, curriculum development, and educational research.",,,1,5359,pd051743,Cleared,2002-09-30,https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/national-facilities/pd05-1743,Program,https://www.nsf.gov/policies/pappg
Linguistics,"The Linguistics Program supports basic science in the domain of human language, encompassing investigations of the grammatical properties of individual human languages, and of natural language in general. Research areas include syntax, semantics, morphology, phonetics and phonology.
The program encourages projects that are interdisciplinary in methodological or theoretical perspective, and that address questions that cross disciplinary boundaries, such as (but not limited to):

What are the psychological processes involved in the production, perception, and comprehension of language?
What are the computational properties of language and/or the language processor that make fluent production, incremental comprehension or rapid learning possible?
How do the acoustic and physiological properties of speech inform our theories of natural language and/or language processing?
What role does human neurobiology play in shaping the various grammatical properties of language?
How does language develop in natural learning contexts across the life-span?
What social and cultural factors underlie language variation and change?

Because NSF's mandate is to support basic research, the Linguistics Program does not fund research that takes as its primary goal improved clinical practice or applied policy, nor does it support work to develop or assess pedagogical methods or tools for language instruction.
The Linguistics Program accepts proposals for a variety of project types: research proposals from scholars with PhDs or equivalent degrees, proposals for Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (LING-DDRI) awards, and CAREER proposals. We will also consider proposals for conferences. Funding requests for conference support should be submitted in accordance with the Conference Proposals section of Chapter II of NSF's Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG).
NSF's Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS), in partnership with the National Endowment for the Humanities and in collaboration with programs in other NSF Directorates, supports efforts to develop and advance knowledge and infrastructure that will enable the analysis of languages that are both understudied and at risk of falling out of use. In recognition of the critical relevance of these languages to understanding the range and limits of human linguistic and cultural variation, BCS accepts research and dissertation proposals in response to solicitations NSF Dynamic Language Infrastructure - NEH Documenting Endangered Languages (DLI-DEL) and Dynamic Language Infrastructure - Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (DLI-DDRI).

"NSF Boosting Research Ideas for Transformative and Equitable Advances in Engineering","The National Science Foundation’s strategic goals are to expand knowledge and build capacity for a diverse science and engineering workforce [1,2].  The goal of this solicitation is to enable and create opportunities to advance scientific discoveries and new research using a variety of approaches that harness the national talent ecosystem of experienced faculty.  Recognizing that a successful faculty research career is neither linear nor continuous, this BRITE solicitation seeks proposals that enable experienced researchers and scholars (tenured or equivalent) to forge new directions or to enter new fields by capitalizing or branching out of their established knowledge domains. 
All BRITE proposals are expected to address fundamental research that creates new knowledge in one or more CMMI program areas.  BRITE proposals must identify key research outcomes and describe the research plans for the period of funding sought.  Although collaborative proposals are not permitted and will be returned without review, the PI can include a collaborator in a limited role as senior personnel.  The solicitation includes four funding tracks: Synergy, Pivot, Relaunch, and Fellow in support of experienced scientists and engineers (tenured or equivalent).

The BRITE Synergy Track is intended to support synthesis research borne out of a disaggregated and accumulated body of prior research outcomes that remain unstudied and unprobed to forge or conceptualize a novel direction, methodology, paradigm, or outcome that is more than the sum of the parts. 


The BRITE Pivot Track is intended to enable researchers to quickly adapt to the fast-moving pace of research and create new knowledge and research products in their field by infusing new concepts from a different discipline or sub-field.


The BRITE Relaunch Track is intended to support tenured or equivalent faculty, who have had a pause in research activity, to relaunch back into active research, and to diversify the experiences of the nation’s STEM researchers.


The BRITE Fellow Track is intended to support established tenured or equivalent researchers who have demonstrated impact beyond scientific output to request extended time and freedom to use their intellectual creativity to explore divergent, bold, and ambitious research ideas where the expected scientific outcomes are highly uncertain and, therefore, high-risk.  

PIs interested in submitting to the Synergy, Pivot, or Fellow track are strongly encouraged to assess the suitability of their proposal topic prior to submission.  All funded projects will form an NSF BRITE cohort and investigators will participate in NSF-organized convenings in the form of an annual review. 
The expected funding ranges for BRITE Research Grants are:
$100,000-$200,000 per year
The award duration is 2 years for the BRITE Synergy track awards, 3 years for the BRITE Pivot and Relaunch tracks, and 5 years for the Fellow track awards. Variations from the typical durations will be considered with a clearly stated justification.
BRITE proposals responding to this solicitation must include additional sections within the 15-page Project Description entitled: Past Contributions, Research Approach and Research Plan, Track Relevance, Outcomes, and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Plan.  Please see “Full Proposal Preparation Instructions” for additional details.  Investigators who do not align with one of the tracks are not eligible for this solicitation. 
 
FURTHER INFORMATION: An informational webinar about this solicitation will be held on February 3rd, 2022 at 2:00 PM ET. Details about how to register and join this webinar are provided below.
